We're now a week in to my first class at Hunter. It's a little early
for me to really compare and contrast the high school to college
experience but I thought I'd share some thoughts on a tool that I've
recently started to play with.
</p>

<p>
My students were all supposed to be issued laptops at the beginning of
the semester. The plan was to have them learn Linux, the command line,
and a little DevOps along the way. I guess I shouldn't have been too
surprised to learn that the laptops weren't going to come in until
late September.
</p>

<p>
Scratch all that advance lesson planning. A brief scramble and I was
able to relocate the class into a computer lab but now we can't
customize the kids environments. 
</p>

<p>
Time to look for an online solution.
</p>

<p>
We're starting the kids off in Python, a choice that I'll talk about
in some future post and normally my online go to for Python is
<a href="http://codesters.com">codesters.com</a>. I'm a big fan of the codesters team and product. This
time, though, I decided to try something else. Specifically <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>. Partly because, as with
codesters, I like the people behind it. It's also pretty simple and it
supports a lot of different languages:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
APL, ES2015 ,Bloop, BrainF, C, CoffeeScript, C++, C++11, C#, Emoticon,
Forth, F#, Go, Java, JavaScript, LOLCODE, Lua, Nodejs, PHP, Python,
Python3, QBasic, Roy, Ruby, Rust, Scheme, Swift, Unlambda, and HTML, CSS, JS
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's still a pretty new product so there are occasional hiccups but
I'm really liking things so far. Some of the things I like include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a simple clean interface.
</li>
<li>sharing and embedding code:
</li>
</ul>
<script src="//repl.it/embed/DF3m/19.js"></script><ul class="org-ul">
<li>project mode which allows multi file projects
</li>
<li>examples to get you started
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the thing I'm really liking are the teacher features they're
working on. The teacher interface isn't fancy. I like that. Things are
simple and clean and they let me get the job done.
</p>

<p>
I had two extra minutes in class yesterday and in that time, I was
able to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make a classroom
</li>
<li>Invite all my students by email
</li>
<li>Create 2 quick assignments.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The assignment page lets you give starter code as well as instructions
and it also lets you put in tests that are run when a student submits
their work for instant feedback.
</p>

<p>
I really like the tests feature on projects. So far, I've only played
with Python unit tests. Repl.it uses a really easy to follow
interface and has a sample test to guide you. There's also an option
for input/output matching which includes flexible matching and regular
expressions but I haven't played with it yet.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I'm liking this tool. When the kids get their laptops we'll
probably use it somewhat less as they start to learn to use their own
systems but I'm glad to have repl.it in my teaching arsenal.

I saw this headline earlier today: <a href="http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/coding-bootcamps-just-got-a-big-boost.html">The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech</a>.
</p>

<p>
The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools
will be able to accept federal student aid. I don't know if we're
talking student loans or  grants but I'm not sure it matters.
</p>

<p>
The headline sounds great. I'm not so sure that this is a good thing.
</p>

<p>
My thinking's evolved over the years but right now, everything tells
me that public funds and for profit education don't mix.
</p>

<p>
What we, more often than not, end up with is a cash cow for a private concern. 
</p>

<p>
Example one: The edTPA - a required exam for teacher licensing, at
least in NY. Prospective teachers pay hundreds of dollars to pass this
gatekeeper. Pearson, a private company (and not even an American one)
is essentially in charge of teacher licensing. They make the
assessments, they grade them, they decide who passes. A foreign
company is deciding who teaches our kids and at great expense to those
prospective teachers.
</p>

<p>
We'd be much better off going back to the old days. To become a
teacher, you had to pass through "The board of examiners." Basically,
to get your permanent license you had to do an oral defense. Teachers
would be placed in a room of principals, supervisors, and master
teachers for an open grilling. It was cheaper and MUCH more
effective. 
</p>

<p>
Example two: The PSAT 8/9, PSAT, and SAT. These are exams that tell us
one thing: how kids will do on future PSAT and SAT tests. They're not
good predictors of college success but the college board (a non-profit
in name only) has convinced us, or at least "convinced" our
politicians of the exams importance. So, rather than having
individuals make a choice as to whether or not to take these exams, NY
forks over who knows how much money per year so that our kids can take
a test with the belief that the exam will mystically make them college
ready. To make matters worse, students lose a day of instruction and
teachers have to proctor the exam instead of teaching.
</p>

<p>
Example three: Common core tests. Made in secret, graded in secret
with cut off scores designed after the fact. Absolutely no educational
value but once again, public funds flow freely into testing companies.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that these private concerns never really have to show
results and they're never held accountable and since the money we pay
them is hidden in city and state budgets, the taxpayer is none the wiser.
</p>

<p>
So, what about code schools?
</p>

<p>
In a similar vein, money will flow from the government to the code
schools. The question is, do they really have the secret sauce.
</p>

<p>
I have lots of friends who run and work in code schools and have met
many more. Some code schools are trying to really educate and some
not so much. In any case, let's take a look.
</p>

<p>
You frequently hear about the success stories but for every one of
those, you can also find a manager talking about the fact that the
code school graduate can't do anything other than ape the narrow tool
that they were exposed to in the three or so months at the code
school. So, the truth is that results are probably a mixed bag.
</p>

<p>
Is this good? Well, when you consider the typical code school MO it
really isn't.
</p>

<p>
To attend a for profit code school you have to not only afford the
tuition but also be able to sustain yourself for the duration of the
program. That makes most code schools options for the well to do -
those already well positioned for success.
</p>

<p>
Then they make the candidates go through pre-work – frequently online
course work. So, before you even step into a code school, they know
you're likely going to succeed. 
</p>

<p>
Once in, they train the candidates in a narrow slice of tech. I've
talked to a number of code school leaders about that. I've asked how
well the kids would be able to adapt given the constraints of their 3
month or so training. The typical answer was that the candidate could
just re-up and pay again to learn the next limited time only skill.
</p>

<p>
Should taxpayer dollars go to this? Probably not. There's no
indication that code schools can provide meaningful long lasting
education to even those who are best prepared to learn on their
own. Whats' more, we haven't seen evidence that they have the answers
for the under-served. Combine that with government's history of not
keeping an eye on and not holding accountable private education
providers, I think we're just setting up a new line of corporate
welfare that will, on the surface help some but it is in no way the
answer. 
</p>

<p>
Too often public/private means that the private entity gets the money
and the public gets stuck holding the bag. Better would be to have
tech companies foot the bill. Some coding schools already do
this. Tech companies that are happy with coding school graduates can
finance the program. 
</p>

<p>
What we should be doing is focusing on things like community
colleges. Organizations that are supposed to be real, long term,
community centers. With moderate tweaking, there's no reason why a
community college, not to mention 4 year schools, couldn't provide far
superior preparation than even the best code school.

Sorry for the incosistancy of the posts. I hope to get to that one
video a week soon but I've still got a hectic couple of weeks ahead.
</p>

<p>
No new material this week, or at least very little. This week, I talk
about some thoughts on the "Using Emacs" series. 
</p>

<p>
In the video I talk about Sacha Chua and her work as a leader in the
Emacs community. Check out her stuff here: <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/">http://sachachua.com/blog/</a>
</p>

<p>
Here's the video - I hope you enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
As always, please leave feedback here or on the video.

It turns out that <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy">Elpy</a>, a popular emacs package for python development
is much easier to set up than I remember. It turns out all you need
is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">elpy</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
<span class="nv">:config</span> 
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">elpy-enable</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The video shows how to install and a bit of use. I don't think it's a
package I'm going to use much since I use other tools to do similar
things but it's worth checking out. 
</p>

<p>
The main event this week is <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet">yasnippet</a>, a package that lets you expand
text aliases. Let's say you want to put the fairly standard:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
in my file. I can just type <b><b>ifm</b></b> and then hit the <b><b>TAB</b></b> key and
it would expand to the above code. Yasnippet also lets you leave
placeholders for variables, function names and more. It's a pretty
neat package.
</p>

<p>
I use it for boilerplate code. The example in the video shows how I
set up a snippet for the boilerplate code used when creating an
application with the <b><b>Flask</b></b> python microframework.
</p>

<p>
Setting up yasnippet is as easy as:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">yasnippet</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">yas-global-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
and it has built in support for <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/tree/9ce0b05f4b4d693831e67dd65d660716a8192e8d">tons of langauges</a>. You can also easily
create your own snippets. See the documentation for details on the
file format. Just create a text file for the snippet and place it in a
subidectory under the snippets subdirectory of .emacs.d. The name of
the subdirectory should be the name of the emacs mode for which the
snippet is defined. I put up the snippet I use for flask so feel free
to check that out.

This week, we're going to look at my setup for Python programming. 
</p>

<p>
I'm an educator, not a professional developer so I'm not working in
huge code bases with dozens or more files at a time. I do periodically
work in medium size code bases and will talk about cross file
navigation and project management later on. There are also more
powerful emacs Python packages. One being <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy">elpy</a>. Elpy looks pretty cool
but for me, it's overkill.
</p>

<p>
Today's about the basics.
</p>

<p>
The first tool I show is <a href="http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a>. It does code checking on the fly
and supports <a href="http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#flycheck-languages">tons of languages</a>. You might have to install some
external checkers though. For instance, I installed <b><b>pylint</b></b> for
python syntax checking with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install pylint
</pre></div>

<p>
Cofiguring flycheck is as easy as:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">flycheck</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-flycheck-mode</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
The video all shows how I like to run Python from within emacs.
</p>

<p>
The other tool I use is <a href="https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi">Jedi</a>. It provides more extensive completion
for Python.
</p>

<p>
Here's the setup:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">jedi</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'python-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'jedi:setup</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'python-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'jedi:ac-setup</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The last hook sets up the autocomplete. 
</p>

<p>
For jedi to work, you'll need to install the jedi server which is done
in emacs by running <b><b>M-x jedi:install-server</b></b>. For that to work,
though, you'll need to have <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">Python Virtualenv</a> istalled. I did that
with:
</p>

<p>
<b><b>EDIT:</b></b> I just got a report that you might need to also install epc (<b><b>sudo pip install epc</b></b>).
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install virtualenv
</pre></div>

<p>

Earlier today I read <a href="http://www.eliothorowitz.com/blog/2016/07/25/innovate-vs-appropriate/">this post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/eliothorowitz">Eliot Horowitz</a>, founder and CTO of MongoDB.
</p>

<p>
Eliot titled the post "Innovate vs Appropriate" and talks about the
importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to
use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is
discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it's well worth a read
but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to "disrupt"
education.
</p>

<p>
I've witnessed this disruption or Ed Reform for the last decade
plus. The basic notion that public education isn't working so we need
to disrupt things. We've suffered through:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Vouchers
</li>
<li>Charters
</li>
<li>Online "learning" replacing teachers
</li>
<li>Teach for America and other temp type efforts
</li>
<li>Merit pay
</li>
<li>VAM for teacher evaluation
</li>
<li>and more
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These disruptions are brought to you by your friendly neighborhood
billionaire "philanthropist" or your politicians.
</p>

<p>
By and large, they haven't worked.
</p>

<p>
Bill Gates got us to close down community schools and create small
ones. While we did need more small schools, overall it didn't work
(<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-epstein/small-schools-miracle-or_b_2641400.html?utm_hp_ref=new-york">link</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A">link</a>). VAM teacher evaluation is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A">arbitrary and capricious</a>,
merit pay has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-why-merit-pay-for-teachers-doesnt-work/2011/03/29/AFn5w9yB_blog.html">never worked</a>, nor does the <a href="http://educationnext.org/online-charters-mostly-dont-work-forum-virtual-schools-greg-richmond/">online thing</a>. Meanwhile, charter
schools by and large <a href="http://www.nea.org/home/32999.htm">don't do better</a> than public schools.
</p>

<p>
Rather than saving our schools, these efforts have lowered teacher
morale and done little for our most vulnerable children.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the difference between ed disruption and the tech world?
Well, for starters, those disrupting education totally ignore the very
advice that Eliot posted about today.
</p>

<p>
Disruption to and of our public schools hasn't been a matter
appropriating what works and innovating what needs to be innovated but rather
a playground for pet projects of politicians and well meaning rich
folk.  Rather than looking at something simple that works, like, say,
smaller class sizes, we get computerized testing. Instead of
experienced teachers, we get inexperienced newbies that leave after
their commitment is up.
</p>

<p>
Why the difference? It hit me while reading Eliot's post. When a
founder is "disrupting" he has skin in the game - it's his company -
sink or swim. Not so for education reformers. Politicians merely need
to be re-elected.Sso as long as something looks good short term, it is
good. Those who disrupt schools are never held accountable. We got
small schools and VAM from among other places, Bill Gates. He admitted
his reforms didn't work but was there any penalty for disrupting so
many lives? Nope. For politicians, it's the same story. As Mayor Mike
Bloomberg once said "If they don't like my education policy, they can
boo me at parades."
</p>

<p>
Can we fix this? Sure, but not unless those forcing the changes have
real skin in the game. Will it happen? I'm not holding my breath.

Happy to be back after a couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
My wife and son spent some time in San Francisco, Mountain View, and
Seattle. The main reason was to see our daughter who's interning out
there for the summer but it was also a great opportunity to catch up
with over 100 former students. If you're interested in seeing more, I
wrote a bit about it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/end-to-act-1/#.V45OGt9vGAk">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was originally going to start talking about Python development but
then saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4sp0xs/emacs_org_mode_and_revealjs/">this</a> post on reddit about <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js</a> and using it with
org-mode. Since reveal.js with org-mode  is my goto presentation tool
I thought I'd do a video on that before getting back to "your
regularly schedueld program."
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psDpCpcIVYs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
The main package you have to use for reveal.js presentations in
org-mode is org-reveal. The package to install is <b><b>ox-reveal</b></b>. I also
installed <b><b>htmlize</b></b> for syntax highlighting. Here's the code from
our configuration file:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">ox-reveal</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">ox-reveal</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-reveal-root</span> <span class="s">"http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-reveal-mathjax</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">htmlize</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The org-reveal-root setq tells your presentation where to find the
reveal.js code. In this example, we're getting from the cloud. You can
also install it locally.
</p>

<p>
The org-reveal-mathjax is just so that LaTeX equations will look nice.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping the video is pretty self-explanitory and the org-reveal
<a href="https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal%0A">home page</a> is pretty thorough but since the documentation is lagging a
bit behind the code and due to some versioning issues, here are a
couple of things to watch out for:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I made a <b><b>samples</b></b> folder where I'll put code for this series that
isn't part of the configurations.
</li>
<li>I showed <b><b>:frag (roll-in)</b></b> as an example of revealing list items
one at a time. Those parens are important and are needed but weren't
in earlier versions - this took me far too long to figure out. 
</li>
<li>If you read the docs you'll see that there are many more transitions
and you can mix and match them on a page.
</li>
<li>You might have to upgrade your emacs packages. If you
<b><b>list-packages</b></b>  in eamcs it will tell you if you have packages to
upgrade. You mark them for upgrading by typing <b><b>U</b></b> and then do the
upgrade with <b><b>x</b></b>. If this doesn't work, you can try getting rid fo
the <b><b>elpa</b></b> folder and then re-installing.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://github.com/zamansky/mazelesson">mazelesson</a> sample presentation shows more features, many that we
haven't covered yet. Check it out but remember that it's for an
earlier version of org-reveal.
</li>
<li>Github pages and rawgit are cool.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hope you enjoy this. Please add any reveal.js tips and tricks of your
own.

<p>
If I look at my leaving Stuyvesant and the NYC Department of
Education to join Hunter College as the end of Act I of my teaching
career, then our family's West Coast swing was a nice way to pull
down the curtain.
</p>

<p>
The impetus for the trip was visiting Batya - she's interning at
Facebook this summer and having an absolute blast.
</p>

<p>
The plan was to spend a few days in San Francisco, then a little south
to Mountain View, where Batya was staying, and then fly up to Seattle
for a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
Of course, while out there, why not see if some of the StuyCS family
wanted to get together.
</p>

<p>
I knew I had a lot of former students out on the West Coast but still, I was
overwhelmed and humbled by the number of people who wanted to spend
time and catch up. 
</p>

<p>
We kicked things off at Bloomberg Beta thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat">Roy Bahat.</a> Roy was
never actually my student but we've gotten to know each other over the
years and I value him as a friend and advisor. Roy provided the food
and the space and about 60 former students + a few old timers showed.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/end-act-1/bloomberg.jpg" alt="bloomberg.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
A couple of days later, we had a lunch meetup for the Googlers:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/end-act-1/google.jpg" alt="google.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
and a happy hour at Facebook (sorry, no picture). Then in Seattle, a
nice dinner to close things out.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/end-act-1/seattle.jpg" alt="seattle.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
Between these events there were some lunches, a barbecue at Batya's
place  and even a drive by visit with a former student at
Microsoft. Overall, it was easily over 100 students over the course of
the week or so we were out there.
</p>

<p>
I've often said that one of the things I'm proudest of is helping to
build the StuyCS family. A community of people spanning decades. Over
the week, we had events mixing students from the mid 90's to
youngsters currently in college and on their internships.
</p>

<p>
Seeing all these people meeting and supporting each other gave me a
"proud pappa" type feeling even though I didn't do any more than set
the stage for them getting together.
</p>

<p>
Over the week, the conversations were also great - not the straight
tech ones, but the ones that really made me proud of the crew. From
Seth talking about how to better get good CS Ed to more kids, to PJ
discussing why he feels it's so important to be an active mentor to
his young programmers and how to get them to be real thinkers, to
Mike, Sam, Kathy, and Leo discussing the disconnect between
privileged families and those struggling to get by. 
</p>

<p>
What more could a teacher want than their former students being both
happy in their lives and careers as well as good people seeking to
make the world better for everyone.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that made me sad about the trip is that with all the
big events, I really didn't get a chance to spend the time I wanted
with everyone. I hope to do better next time.
</p>

<p>
So, I've now been at Hunter for one semester and things will really
ramp up in the Fall. I'm still a proud part of our StuyCS family and if
being a part of pulling it together is the legacy I left, I can live
with that.
</p>

<p>
The trip was a nice symbolic way to lower the curtain on act 1. I'm
counting on the StuyCS family and all the other players to help so
that we can make sure act 2 is a success and we can build something
similar for more young people throughout the city and perhaps the country.

I'll be traveling for the next couple of weeks so I probably won't
have time for another video until mid to late July. I'll probably
write a post about this series and do some regular blogging over that
time but probably no new videos for a couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
Also, a couple of notes about the series:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Instead of making a separate git branch for each episode, I'm just
adding on to the master branch on GitHub. If you're not familiar
with Git and GitHub don't worry about this. Hardly anyone will
notice a difference.
</li>
<li>If this theme doesn't show well on video, please let me know, I'll
change it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ok, now to this installments video.
</p>

<p>
It talks about using org-mode to store our emacs init file.
</p>

<p>
The first key is that you can put code-blocks in org-mode:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(emacs-lisp code goes here)
(more emacs lisp goes here)
(and you can have even more here)
#+END_SRC
</pre></div>

<p>
Since it's elisp you can run the individual line using the usual <b><b>C-x C-e</b></b>
but you can run the entire block by placing your cursor anywhere in
the block and typing <b><b>C-c C-c</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
One minor annoyance about editing code blocks is that it doesn't do
syntax highlighting or auto indentation. To solve this, emacs lets you
pull up an editing buffer by typing <b>*C-c '*</b>. 
</p>

<p>
You're supposed to be able to save your changes with <b>*C-c '*</b> again
or <b><b>C-x C-s</b></b> and kill the buffer without saving changes with <b><b>C-x
C-k</b></b> 
but the version of org-mode that came with my version of emacs
didn't support it - I had to install a newer version of org-mode from
melpa. 
</p>

<p>
I couldn't figure out how to do this via use-package, but if this
problem happens to you, you can just type <b><b>Alt-x package-install</b></b>
and then type <b><b>org</b></b> and hit enter to install it.
</p>

<p>
Once you do that, you might have to reload emacs but then everything
should work. 
</p>

<p>
This lets us move most of our configuration to a separate file. We're
calling it <b><b>myinit.org</b></b> and storing it in our .emacs.d
directory. You can use any name <b><b>except</b></b> init.org as I mentioned in
the video.
</p>

<p>
The file's a little big so here's a link to it:
<a href="https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/myinit.org">https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/myinit.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Notice how GitHub formats it to look all nice.
</p>

<p>
Here's the raw file so you can see the gory details:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamansky/using-emacs/master/myinit.org">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamansky/using-emacs/master/myinit.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Since we're loading the file in overview mode, when we load it in
emacs we see:

We can tab open and close each section and add text to clarify things
around the code blocks.
</p>

<p>
All that's left in <b><b>init.el</b></b> is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">package-enable-at-startup</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
With the last line performing the magic of loading our org file and
running all the code blocks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we added a couple of small interface changes:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fset</span> <span class="ss">'yes-or-no-p</span> <span class="ss">'y-or-n-p</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-set-key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">kbd</span> <span class="s">"&lt;f5&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ss">'revert-buffer</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The first line lets us type y or n instead of yes or no and the second
let's us reload a file into our current buffer using the <b><b>f5</b></b> key.

    <p>
Yesterday I read over Hillary's briefing on her initiative on
<a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/">Technology and Innovation</a>.
</p>

<p>
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have
my doubts. My feeling is that she's pretty much aligned with the
current administration education wise and the current administration
has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public
education.
</p>

<p>
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much
like some of the others, I don't want to get into that today. I want
to focus on one specific part of her plan. The part that defers
college debt for up to 3 years for founders and entrepreneurs. This
sounds great but is this really a good thing?
</p>

<p>
Some initial responses from the education community is "what about
young teachers, don't they deserve some help on college debt? What
about nurses?…" and of course they're right. On the other hand, I
don't want people to go into teaching for 2 or 3 years just to get
some debt relief benefit and then jump ship. That's the Teach for
America model that I feel has become so harmful.
</p>

<p>
But again, that's not where I'm going with this.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with "who are these founders?" I don't have any hard data
but I have read a couple of recent pieces that indicate that founders
right out of college are typically from well to do backgrounds. This
of course makes sense. A kid up to his or her eyes in debt from a poor
background. No savings, no property, likely a family, that is siblings
and parents who are also treading water can ill afford to take a big
financial risk. A kid from a monied family? Much more so. 
</p>

<p>
This alone makes Hillary's plan a boon for the wealthy but not so
much for the people we need to give a hand up.
</p>

<p>
Next, this plan talks about the founders and only says it will
"explore similar incentives"  for early employees, citing "10 to 20."
This doesn't seem right to me.
</p>

<p>
Now let's look further into the benefits. I don't know what the
success and failure rates are for startups. I've seen a bunch of
figures including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>90% of startups fail within the first three years
</li>
<li>Three out of four startups fail 
</li>
<li>Of 10 startups, 3 or 4 totally fail, 3 or 4 break even and the
others turn a profit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't know where the truth lies but I'd imagine that the success
rate for startup by a recent college graduate, wet behind the ears is
probably higher than for a more season professionals.
</p>

<p>
Hillary's plan defers debt for up to three years. If any of the
failure numbers cited above are near correct it means that these kids
will have burned through up to three years with the experience of a
failed startup to show for it.
</p>

<p>
I've always advised my students, all things being equal, start at a
big or mid size company, develop your chops, learn how they do it,
further build out your network, and then go out and do your
thing. Most kids are better served not going directly from college to
their first startup.
</p>

<p>
So there it is. A plan that makes for great "press release" but is it
really addressing the issues?
