&lt;p&gt;
The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was "How do I assess CS?" I
wanted to go but it's been such a crazy month I was just too wiped
out. Fortunately, the meetup was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIMKAZbHAiA&amp;amp;index=83&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;t=1796s"&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to watch the
first half this morning while working out on my &lt;a href="https://www.staczero.com/hero"&gt;stationary trainer&lt;/a&gt;
which leads me to today's rare Saturday morning blog
post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12
teachers who taught CS. I can't talk about the second panel yet since I'm
only halfway through but there were a couple of points made by my
friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KatieJergens"&gt;Katie Jergens&lt;/a&gt; who teaches at Dalton that I thought were worth
talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first was when Katie noted that through working with the panel,
one of her takeaways was that:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Giving students an explicit strategy for solving a problem - "this is
how I would do it….," - giving them an explicit strategy first and then giving them a
problem for which that strategy would apply is much more effective than
having them discover it on their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was refreshing to hear after being beaten over the head on
discovery learning and constructivism for the past five or so
years as being the magic bullet for teachers. I shared more thoughts
on this a few weeks ago when I wrote about a SIGCSE paper presented by
&lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-bootstrap/"&gt;Bootstrap World&lt;/a&gt; that I very much liked. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Katie went on to talk about how the group found that while "discovery
learning" can be effective it can also be frustrating and lose kids
along the way. It also takes a lot of time and preparation, something
that's short on supply in most public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This made me think about the recent flurry
of discussion around the debunking of learning styles which had
previously been the magic bullet. When I started, the secret sauce was cooperative
learning. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course any good teacher knows there's no magic bullet. You fill
your tool belt and chest with as much as you can and use what's
best based on your strengths as a teacher combined with what will work
best with your students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another point that Katie made that I found refreshing had to do with 
something she does with her classes. A good portion of a student's grade is
based on what she calls a "booster." Each student has to work one on
one with her on some project. The student either scores a 0 or a 100 -
the student keeps working with the direct support of the teacher until
it's perfect. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The important thing that Katie said with respect to this is "I can
do this because my largest class is sixteen students." No way could
this ever scale to a public school where a teacher can meet with over
150 students a day and barely has time eat lunch let alone
work one on one with a student in a suitably quiet place like an
office. The refreshing thing to hear was the acknowledgment of the
fact that what works in a rich private school won't work in a public
school. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All to often education and yes, CS Ed is driven by people who
really have no clue. They're anointed as thought leaders but they
don't walk the walk. Some have some knowledge and experience but many
don't. Until you've gotten a few years under your belt in a strap
cashed public school that takes all comers, don't tell them how they
should do it. Katie didn't - she acknowledged the problem - too bad so
many others don't. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the video during a future
workout and might have more to share then. For now, take a look for
yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e41e12"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
About a week ago New York State's new regulation creating a &lt;a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers"&gt;K12 CS
teacher certification&lt;/a&gt; went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter"&gt;Matt Flamm&lt;/a&gt; of Crain's New York in a &lt;a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new"&gt;follow up piece&lt;/a&gt;
about it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is &lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt;. In my view, it's a game changer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From a course offerings point of view it's the wild west. I don't mean
this as a bad thing, it's just that there's a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there's a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we're going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People say we'll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I've never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma's call so why can't we find CS teachers? Because we've
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school's math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Having CS certification alone won't woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we'll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won't happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I've hit the sweet
spot with what I've designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don't agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like "APCS - Principles for teachers" or "APCS - A for
teachers."  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we'll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there's a lot more to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>certification</category><category>cs</category><category>policy</category><category>teaching</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 21:39:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Refactoring</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-orge6d16aa" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orge6d16aa"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge6d16aa"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my laments on teaching computer science is that students are
rarely taught and given the chance to develop  good programming
practices. There's usually not enough time. Beginners work on small
"toys" which don't lend themselves to good software development
practices and later on, there's so much other material like
algorithms, data structures etc. to teach and
learn that programming practices usually amount to lines like:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Make sure to comment your code.."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Indent properly…"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Use functions…"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"It's important to test your code…"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
so when I see an opportunity to use a simple example to drive home a
good practice,  I try to jump on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Drawing shapes with text is a typical early project. I've seen it in
text books and online and have been doing it for years. I recall doing
it back in the 80s in Fortran IV when the programs we wrote were on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card"&gt;punch cards&lt;/a&gt;, run
overnight on an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130"&gt;IBM 1130&lt;/a&gt;, and printouts picked up the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice use of nested loops. The students will write functions to
create assorted shapes out of asterisks  like rectangles and
triangles. Typical solutions look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Which results in shapes like these:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;

| ****            |    | *               |
| ****            |    | **              |
| ****            |    | ***             |
| ****            |    | ****            |
| ****            |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
| *************** |    | *               |
| *************** |    | **              |
| *************** |    | ***             |
| *************** |    | ****            |
| *************** |    | *****           |
| *************** |    | ******          |
| *************** |    | *******         |

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then there will be more interesting shapes including things like:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;

   *       *            *****
  **      ***           *   *            and more
 ***     *****          *   *
****      ***           *****
           *   

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a great time to talk about refactoring.  All of the shape
drawing functions follow the same pattern - there's an outer loop for
the height and then one or more inner loops to draw each line. We can
factor out the inner loops in to a separate &lt;code&gt;line()&lt;/code&gt; function.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;----- This can be factored out&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;                                 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;---------------- along with this&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;                               &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's just like factoring in algebra:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="LATEX"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(RectangleOuterLoop × Line) + (TriangleOuterLoop × Line) ⇒ Line  (Rectangleouterloop × TriangleOuterloop)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We end up with:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
It's simpler, cleaner, and also can lead us to thinking about the
"harder" shapes in an interesting way. Instead of looking at the right
justified triangle as a triangle, we can think of each level as two
lines - one of spaces (shown here as dashes) followed by a line of
stars:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
----*       *
---**      **
--***     ***
-****    ****
*****   *****

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Noticing that  for a height of 5, the dashed lines count down in
length 4,3,2,1,0 and the star lines count up 1,2,3,4,5, we get:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"-"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;endl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here we have typical early CS assignment that really lends itself to
talking about structuring programs and refactoring. Where else can we
inject good programming practices in ways that make sense early on?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc43063e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really didn't know what to expect at the &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159471"&gt;Creativity, Customization,
and Ownership: Game Design in Bootstrap: Algebra&lt;/a&gt; session. I've been a
big fan of &lt;a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/"&gt;Bootstrep&lt;/a&gt; for years and looking at the authors, &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/10/cs-teacher-interview-emmanuel.html"&gt;Emmanuel
Schanzer&lt;/a&gt;'s been a freind forever. I've never met &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi"&gt;Shriram Krishnamurthi&lt;/a&gt;
in person but am looking forward to it. We've traded emails and blog
comments. I'd like to consider him a friend and I certainly respect
him and his work even though we frequently disagree around the
edges. The third author and presenter, Kathi Fisler was new to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Bootstrap program is embedded in algebra classes. In it, students
use Racket (nee scheme) to reinforce math skills while building
computer science skills. The big student project is a graphical game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When designing the project, students are asked to decide on and find
four resources:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enemy image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students are given a short amount of time to decide on and find these
four images. I think it was about ten minutes and that's it. That's
all the "creativity" in the assignment. After that, all the students
are essentially creating the same game with different skins.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This design makes sense. You can't have students going all over the
place. Constraining the assignment in this way allows teachers who
might now be strong in computer science to guide the kids through the
program to completion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the time I was thinking: I really like all of this but is it really
open ended creativity and discovery with respect to math or computer
science? As it turned out, Fisler addressed this point at the end of
the talk in a way that made me vary happy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fisler went on to describe the rest of the student experience and then
went on to talk about the statistics they gathered. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One big takeaway was that while all the students were essentially
writing the same game varying only the graphical elements, this
encouraged students to create very different themes. They also created
rich stories around their games. The project might not have been
"creative" with respect to the CS or Math directions but it was certainly
creative in other important areas. The other takeaway was that
survey's indicated all sorts of positives from the program as a whole
so the project didn't seem to have suffered by having the students
essentially write the same program. Participants were proud of their
work, they felt their games were different from their peers and in
general the experience was good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During questions, someone asked about adding a fifth element - a
projectile or missile. It turns out that at one point the program had a
projectile component but that led to the vast majority of projects to
be themed in very similar ways. Even though not the same, it reminded me to something Randy
Pausch said in his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo"&gt;Last Lecture&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You make whatever you want. Two rules: no shooting violence and no
pornography. Not because I’m opposed to those in particular, but you know, that’s been done with
VR, right? [laughter] And you’d be amazed how many 19-year-old boys are completely out of ideas
when you take those off the table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the very end, Fisler addressed my questions about creativity and
discovery. She posed these questions of her own: "Do we overstate the
case for creativity?" and "Is pure constructivism a win?"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've ranted on contructivism before. It can be great but a
constructivist lesson takes a knowledgeable educator and a lot of time,
preparation, and effort. It's a big ask for, say, a high school
teacher who's already taking home hours of work every evening. Too
often I've seen the following "contructivist" model instead:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an isntructor that doesn't know their craft, the content, or
niether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the kids play with stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show off the couple of autodidacts that figure it out as success
stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'll rant more about this "model" with respect to the new buzz word
"lead learner" at some point in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the creativity side, it's important but there are also times for
the instructor to lead and for guidelines to be followed.
We want to foster creativity but that doesn't mean that it's 100%
creativity 100% of the time. Education is like life, a balance. The
Bootstrap program had to constrain the CS and math learning but
allowed for creativity in other areas. It's smart and it's a win.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I still want to meet Shriram in person one day and now also Kathi
Fisler. I didn't know what to expect walking in but I left the talk
reminded of why I'm such a fan of Emmanuel, his team, and their work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been having fun with this years &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; competition. So
far, I've been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in
another couple of days since I'll be traveling for the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other
solutions on the Advent of Code &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/"&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. Even with similar
agorithmic solutions there's a decent amount of variation in the
actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically
different.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That got me thinking about how the tools we know and use both shape the ways we
approach solving problems and creating things and either limit or
empower us to go from a mental model of a solution or creation to an
actual artifact. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Relating to this are the common themes that come up in the CS
Education world. The idea that it's computer science not programming
and certainly not merely coding. That's true but the tools and
languages we use shape the whole thinking part and can also give the
students a valuable practical tool that they can leverage to great
advantage in both future classes and work and life endeavors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I decided to do this rant as a video. I hope you enjoy it:

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org241fae1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I was one of the judges at &lt;a href="http://stuyhacks.com/"&gt;StuyHacks&lt;/a&gt;. A one day hackathon at
Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don't have attendee
stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team
from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade
and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end
but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There was an incredible variety of projects using a wide array of
tools. There were projects built with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A-Frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python / Flask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML/CSS/JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A personal highlight for me was running into Sophie - the daughter of
two of my students from #Stuy95. Well, both a highlight and a reminder
that I'm getting old.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The StuyHacks team did a terrific job running things and at the end I
told them I'd love to help with future events.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I did notice a couple of things at the hackathon that echo things I've
learned as a teacher over the years and I thought they were worth
sharing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first was the a number of the beginner groups needed more
direction. This didn't seem to be related to grade level or age as
much as CS experience. This isn't a hackathon only issue. It exists in
all learning environments. If as teachers we're too prescriptive
students end up with a single formula to follow. Sure, that'll get
them through a standardized exam like APCS-A but too much of it can
hinder them in becoming creative problem solvers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, not enough structure will leave many kids staring
at a blank page. I remember I gave a quiz years ago. It had one
problem: "You have 20 minutes to prove to me that you learned
something about the past unit on Cellular Autmata" or something like
that. Some kids absolutely loved it but many hated it. Stuy kids are
trained test takers. They're prepared for structure. This threw many
for a loop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I noticed this issue with some of the hackers at StuyHacks. Some
beginners really had a hard time figuring out what they could do and
what they should do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A hackathon isn't a classroom so I think the problem is pretty easily
remedied. Groups that were able to latch on to a good mentor seemed to
get the guidance they needed. A beginners hackathon should make sure
they have not only plenty of mentors but they should make sure that
the mentors are prepped with a number of project ideas in a number of
the standard beginner platforms. A hackathon could also provide an
assortment of ideas in a list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second thing I noticed was at the end of the day as I was
judging. It started with one particular group. They were pretty
apologetic about their project. Basically because it wasn't
finished. Personally, I thought what they accomplished in essentially
7 hours was pretty impressive. What became clear as we talked is that
this group was deathly afraid of failure. Their deepest fear at that
moment was that I was going to give them high marks and they might
have to show off their incomplete (yet rather impressive) project to a
room full of strangers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This fear of failure was prevalent in groups that ultimately didn't
submit their projects for judging and it seemed to be common among
students from high performing, high expectation schools where
frequently one associates a test score or grade with ones value. I'm
not happy to say that Stuy has always had this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This isn't really a problem that a hackathon can or should be able to
address. It's just something I noticed. It's a problem for schools and
also for a society that's test obsessed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope nobody reads too much into these observations. The day was a
tremendous success. A whole bunch of kids had a great day working
together to build cool things with technology. Congratulations to the
StuyHacks team. They did a terrific job putting it all together. If
you're a middle or high school student or know one, keep an eye on the
StuyHacks &lt;a href="http://stuyhacks.com/"&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; and make sure to attend their next event.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f2de2a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We all love interesting problems. The trouble is that it's hard to
find suitably interesting problems for students when they're just
learning the basics. In the very beginning the problems practically
dictate the solution:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loop over a list and add all the elements or calculate the sum of a
list of integers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine if  number is prime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert a word into pig-Latin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not that there's no thought involved in solving these but the
students already know the mechanics of solving these by hand so it's a
direct translation into a program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This isn't a bad thing and it is important but it's fun when we get to the next
level. I've found that a number of the &lt;a href="http://hackerrank.com"&gt;Hacker Rank&lt;/a&gt; archived
competitions have "easy" problems that can be a good fit for
beginners. One that I found and really like is &lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/happy-ladybugs"&gt;Happy Ladybugs&lt;/a&gt; problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problems is basically as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You get a string of letters. Each letter represents a ladybug of a
different color. Each letter also represents a location of the
ladybug.  A space (or underscore in the actual problem) represents a
free space. For example "AABC DDA" is a line of 2 A colored ladybugs
followed by a B colored one, C colored one, a blank space, 2 D colored and then one
more A colored. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can rearrange the line of ladybugs by swapping any ladybug with a
blank space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A ladybug is happy if it is next to another ladybug of the same
color. The challenge is to determine if all the ladybugs can be made
happy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I like this problem because while it is non-trivial it is very
approachable. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To me, the key is that while you can rearrange the list you
don't have to. You only have to determine if it is possible to make
the ladybugs happy. You don't actually have to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The edge cases are pretty easy to deal with - a string of length one
or two but then a little thought is required.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first insight is that if there are no spaces, you can't rearrange
the ladybugs so all you have to do is scan through the string to test
to see if every ladybug has a neighbor of the same color.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next insight, and the big one is that if you have at least one
space you can arbitrarily re-order the string. You can show this is
possible  by using a single space to swap any two elements. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;someletter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;someletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;someotherletter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;someotherletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The final insight is that since you can arbitrarily re-order the
ladybugs as long as you have at least 2 of each color, you can make
them all happy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since my class is currently just starting dictionaries in Python we
solved this with lists and then transitioned to dictionaries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a dictionary based solution:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;are_happy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    This might miss some of the real edge cases in the hackerrank&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    problem. I haven't read the problem carefully in over a year and &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    forget what it specified for things like lists of only spaces,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    lists with only one bug etc.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Also, the Hackerrank question uses an underscore (_) instead of a space.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    '''&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# handle a string of less than 2 ladybugs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# handle the string of 2 ladybugs - both must be the same and not a space&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# handle the case of no spaces &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# no spaces, every item must be next to one of the same color&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# so we loop from 1 to len-1 and for each item&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# check the one before and the one after&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if we ever have an unhappy bug, we can just return False&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if we ever get here every bug has at least one neighbor of the same color&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# we can make them all happy&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# replace the spaces with "" since we don't want to count them&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Since we know they were in the string we can rearrange but&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;counts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bugcounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if there is any value of 1 in the counts then there's a lone ladybug&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# that can't be made happy&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# so we return True (happy) if there are 0 counts of 1 in our list &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; 


&lt;span class="n"&gt;bugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"abaccbe ff eggggggg"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

I just wish there was an easy way to find all contest problems of a

I just read Jeff Yearout's recent post titled &lt;a href="http://k12csteaching.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-beginners-garden-of-concepts.html"&gt;The Beginner's Garden of
Concepts&lt;/a&gt;. Not directly related but it got me thinking about
programming idioms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been using the phrase "programming idiom" for years to describe a
short useful recurring code construct. I didn't realize that it was
officially "a thing" until doing a web search on the phrase years
later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As our students grow from newbies on I think it's helpful for them to
see recurring and related patterns and programming idioms gives us a
name to apply to many beginner patterns. An early idiom might be
"finding the smallest in a list:"
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;min_index&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;min_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;min_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another is the very similar and more general "do something on every
item in a list:"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do something to or with dataset[i]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By talking about constructs like these as idioms it helps students see
and develop coding patterns. It also helps them to build mental
abstractions. Each of the above idioms are a few lines of code but
each are also a single concept. Students learn to think of them as the
concept.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
When students learn about list comprehensions in python they'll
rewrite the "do something…" more like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
but the pattern or idea is the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Other early idioms might include swapping variables:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and loops until an exit condition are met:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;not_exit_condidtion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do stuff&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;modify&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;checks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even more difficult concepts like recursion can be described in an
idiomatic way:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_CASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modify_to_eventually_get_to_base_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Patterns like these, or idioms, come up over and over again. We don't
have to explicitly mention them in our teaching but I think it's
helpful to our students if we do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org92e742e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last year I &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/new-term-new-tool-replit"&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://repl.it"&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt;, an online IDE that supports multiple
languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and
since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I
used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a
lab where I couldn't easily install my own software. I'll continue to
use repl.it - mostly for it's ability to schedule publish and manage
assignments but when possible, I like having my students work
locally. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year I'm excited about another tool - &lt;a href="http://thonny.org"&gt;Thonny&lt;/a&gt;. Thonny's a simple
Python IDE designed for beginners. I discovered it last year but at a
time when it was impractical for me to use with my students. This
year I can and I'm really liking it. I'm still an Emacs guy and will
continue to use Emacs for my python development (&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-12-python/"&gt;video 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-13-yasnippet"&gt;video 2&lt;/a&gt;) but
for beginners I think Thonny is the way to go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of Thonny's highlights:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An integrated Python 3 virtual environment making for ease of
installation and consistency across student installs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A debugger that shows how expressions are evaluated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great visualizations of function calls that make it easier to
understand the call stack and scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to look at memory to understand references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rather than go into the gory details in text, I put together this
video:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org5de70ee"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5de70ee"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing
about my class rules. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Instead I think I'll riff on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;'s post today titled
&lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/09/curriculum-is-hard.html"&gt;Curriculum is Hard&lt;/a&gt;. I'm guessing I found curriculum design and
development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it's
something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a
curriculum your own?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the
whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it's clearly not your
curriculum. It probably also isn't really teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about the more common case. Math curricula has basically been set
for years. Algebra, Geometry &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/theseus%27s-curriculum/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and then Algebra 2
and Trigonometry. Most books seem to be sequenced in a similar way
and at least in the schools I know about, the math department has some
document listing a day by day list of topics. This makes sense since
you probably have more than one class of each type and you want some
cross class consistency. Particularly during the first weeks of the
semester when kids can transfer and then also at the end of term or
year. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When a teacher uses that departmental document are they using someone
elses curriculum?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What if they create their own homeworks and assigments?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most teachers I know use the department's curriculum but make their
own unit and day to day lesson plans. Most revise them each
semester. Typically these teachers do a little more here or a little
less there depending on a number of factors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Are they creating their own curriculum?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What if they re-sequence the topics?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How about adding an enrichment topic?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back when I taught math I used the departmental syllabus, as many
texts as I could find, colleagues lesson plans and whatever I could
find but I always pulled it together to something I could call my
own. If I didn't, I wouldn't have been comfortable going in front of
my class. Was it my curriculum? They were certainly my lessons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, when designing a course I start from the end outcomes and work
backwards but when teaching a course, I still look at as many
resources as I can find. I'll pull a little from here, a little from
there and combine that with whatever I can come up with myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, when is it your curriculum and when is it not? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you're just delivering scripted lessons it's certainly not yours.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you know your stuff and you  take someone elses material, make it
your own and add it to your bag of tricks, I think it's now yours as
well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="text-footnotes"&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/theseus%27s-curriculum/#fnr.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara"&gt;which is really logic and deductive
reasoning using Euclidean Geometry as platform&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
