Everybody know's I'm the Statler and Waldorf of the CS Education
world.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been known to be "prickly," which is a nice way of putting it and
I'm openly critical of many programs out there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One program, however, that I very much like is &lt;a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/"&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;. They've been
around since 2009 founded by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KevinKWang"&gt;Kevin Wang&lt;/a&gt;, a former teacher. I didn't
know what to make out of it when I first heard about them and I'm pretty
skeptical about drop in programs. The basic idea was to have tech
professionals go to a school on the way to work and team teach a CS
class with one of the school's teachers. The tech person would provide
the CS expertise and the teacher would provide the education
chops. They'd both learn from each other and the students from both of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After a couple of years, I started hearing from my former students. As
it turns out, a number of them had independently discovered TEALS and
become volunteers. They all talked about how rewarding the experience
was and how much the kids were getting that they wouldn't have gotten
otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was sold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
TEALS has expanded considerably in the decade since they started. Now
they support multiple classes at multiple levels, have different
models from the original team teaching to a model where the volunteer
is more of a general tech / programming resource and the teacher is
more self sufficient.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, they provide quality training and materials to both
the teachers and the tech volunteers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No drop in program can ever replace well prepared knowledgeable
teachers but in K12 CS very few of those teachers exist and it will
take us years go get there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Until then, TEALS is one of the best programs to get CS education to
our kids and even when we do get there, their ability to connect
schools with volunteers and resources can't be understated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you're a tech professional and want to do some real good, volunteer
with TEALS - here's a link to more information:
