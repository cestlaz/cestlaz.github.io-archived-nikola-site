&lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/do-we-really-need-cs-focused-high.html"&gt;Do we really need CS focused high schools?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my
&lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/that-time-bill-gates-visited-afse"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about Bill Gates' visit to &lt;a href="http://afsenyc.org"&gt;AFSE&lt;/a&gt;, a NYC public school
with a CS focus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On both posts, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reallymdp"&gt;Michael Preston&lt;/a&gt; shared some important and good points about
AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC
and also specifically about AFSE. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In response to Alfred's question I thought it was time I shared a bit
about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved. I wasn't
able to talk publicly about any of this at the time because I was
warned very sternly by one DOE person involved that I shouldn't talk
to "outsiders" about my concerns or designs. In retrospect, since I
stopped getting replies to my emails and was apparently dropped from
email lists after they selected their founding principal, I probably
should have been more public about my critiques. On the other hand, I
should have been more politic internally prior to getting to that
point.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reading Alfred's post, what I was pushing for AFSE at the time cuts
right to Alfred's question so I thought I'd write about it today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before starting though I want to be &lt;b&gt;absolutely clear&lt;/b&gt; about one
thing. This is not a critique of AFSE as it stands. There are some
great teachers and wonderful students there and I do what I can to
support both whenever I can. This is a post about my design vs the
DOE's design and later implementation. Also note that the numbers,
sizes, restrictions and designs are all based on NY state and NYC
requirements along with what one can typically do in a NYC public
school. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though it's the least important issue with respect to a CS school
or not, let's start by getting the dirty word out of the way. Given
the stated mission of the school (at the time) I wanted a screen. Not
a "Stuy test" screen but something. Probably something more along the
lines of the screen used by the Manhattan Science Hunter High
School. We never got that far in discussing it. My contention was and
still is that if you want to produce "Google ready" software engineers
by high school graduation, particularly in a small school, you can't
start with kids 2 or 3 years behind in math. Now, if your goal isn't
"Google ready engineers" but rather to use CS to engage a population
that isn't otherwise engaged, I can get behind that and you don't need
a screen. It's important however to note it's a different mission.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The DOE would maintain that you don't need any screen and kids can
start out years behind and by the end of their senior year they'd be
years ahead. It doesn't work that way. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They'd ask tech people at meetings what they looked for in employees
knowing that they'd get back "teamwork, creativity etc." I would of
course follow up with "where do you look for these candidates" and
they'd say "MIT, Cal Tech, Harvard." 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The DOE insisted on no screen. This is fine but it's no surprise that
Google's not beating down the doors for AFSE graduates right out of
high school and the math regents show that you indeed can't take kids
from multiple years behind and end up with them multiple years ahead
given typical school resources. They're doing really good work there
but there's no such thing as a miracle school just hard work and
incremental progress. I have heard more than once that the founding
principal had lobbied for a screen so I feel my original assessment
was correct.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next up, size. The DOE insisted on a small school focused on CS. They
wanted a school of around 136 kids per grade, which makes for 4
"homerooms," and that the school would focus on CS. My proposal was
very different. I advocated for a school with about 340 kids per grade
and not specifically focused on CS but rather with a great model CS
program - a Software Engineering Institute at the blah blah school if
you would.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A small school can't support a wide range of classes. With 4 classes
of kids per grade you don't have a lot of schedule flexibility in
terms of class levels or electives. You also have very few teachers
per subject - for a subject taught for a full year every year for a
single period, you'd have one teacher per grade in that subject. If
you're a school for CS you're not going to be able to offer a robust
schedule of music or arts classes. Likewise an arts school is going to
be hard pressed to offer a suite of science electives. Remember,
public schools are not flush with money and can't just offer loads of
courses for a handful of kids. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What we end up with is a school with limited offerings beyond CS and
we're asking kids to decide in 8th grade if that's the career path for
them. This is a hidden problem of all small schools. Kids shouldn't
have to decide on their future in the 8th grade. They should all be
able to go to schools that offer a wide range of subjects to a good
degree of depth. Only large public schools can do this. I know that
public schools come with their own problems but this is one of the
trade offs. I believe that having this selection done in 8th grade
along with the tech stereotypes and preconceptions is a big part of
the schools difficulty in appealing to girls.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now even if every student who applied and is randomly accepted into
AFSE does indeed want to be a CS person then we've also lost because
we've done nothing to get more kids into the pool. It could still
potentially function as a model school in terms of courses or possibly
pedagogy but it won't expose and inspire anyone new with respect to
tech.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's contrast that with what I proposed. I wanted around 340 kids per
grade or 10 "homerooms." How did I arrive at that number? It wasn't
just a guess. Schools like Stuyvesant or Brooklyn Tech are clearly too
large and impersonal but small 136 kids per grade schools are too
small. The 10 homeroom per grade school seems to be the best
compromise. There are enough teachers so that there's institutional
memory when one leaves, enough of them and students for a varied set
of electives. It also means that there are enough teachers to avoid
bad fits between teacher and student. At the same time, it's not so
large that kids get lost. I also spoke with some of the best
programmers I know - not computer programmers but people who schedule
students for classes in schools and this seems to be the best
compromise size range. Also, with this size you don't necessarily need
a screen if you want "Google ready" software engineers. There will be
enough of a range kids that come in behind and kids that come in ahead
can get what they need.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also didn't want it to be a CS school but rather a school with great
CS. That way it would appeal to a range of students. Kids who think
they want to do CS and those who don't. At the end of they day some of
the kids that think they wanted CS won't want it and those kids will
have other options. At the same time some of the non-tech kids will
take the required CS and find out that "this is neat stuff" and we get
to increase the number of people in the tent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I still believe my design would have worked out better but that's not
to say that I don't think that AFSE has been and is important. As Mike
pointed out in his comment, AFSE was the first unscreened school to
offer legit and it did (and does) offer a place for CS kids that don't
get into or don't want to go to a place like Stuy which is very much a
large school and an unforgiving machine. It was also a showpiece that
helped pave the way for CS in all NYC schools. All of that's good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I do regret parts of what went down between me and DOE. I don't regret
sticking to my beliefs in terms of school design but I would like to
have been able to handle the politics of the situation better. Had I
remained involved I think I had more to offer. I don't regret it too
much – at the time it went from the DOE telling me one week to "you
can have any role in the school you want" to the next week "we want to
introduce you to the person who we're making principal" and I
recognize that I'd have a hard time putting that aside now and the me
of a decade ago would have found it impossible. That said, I think
everyone would have been better off if both sides could have played
things better. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'd still love to have the chance someday to set up and run a school
of my design with my team. It'll probably never happen but it would be
nice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Alfred Thompson asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo/status/1036982959587446784"&gt;"Why is it important for CS students
to understand binary?"&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter which led to a number of interesting
responses. Alfred summarized and wrote his own thoughts on &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/why-teach-binary-in-computer-science.html"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to add a comment but I already wrote a post for yesterday so
put it off until today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First let me say that you can have a very successful career in tech
and not really know binary or number bases other than 10. That career
could be as as programmer, software engineer, network specialist,
devops or in many other areas that fall on the CS side of tech.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You also can't really get through a CS program without learning about
binary. If you're self taught or go to a code school then that's
another story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The question is, is it worth the time spent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One can easily argue that systems - that is low level, close to the
metal knowledge is one of the two "latins" of CS, the other being CS
theory. You might not explicitly use either but they give you a
stronger foundation in everything. You also can't study systems without a
good knowledge of binary so if you want to do anything low level, you
need it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about beyond those easy but not all to convincing to new students
answers?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's loo at a few things we can do with binary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A big part of binary notation is that you can look at data as a string
of bits. You can also manipulate that data using things like &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At it's core &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; let's you turn off bits. &lt;code&gt;And&lt;/code&gt; any bit with a 0 and
it will become a 0. &lt;code&gt;And&lt;/code&gt; it with a 1 and it stays the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

\begin{array}{ccccc}
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
and &amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\\hline
&amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
\end{array}

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Or&lt;/code&gt; is used to turn on bits. You &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; any bit with a 1 and it gets
turned on. &lt;code&gt;Or&lt;/code&gt; it with a 0 and it stays as it was.
&lt;/p&gt;

\begin{array}{ccccc}
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
or &amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\\hline
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\
\end{array}

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;/code&gt; a bit with a 1 and the bit flips, with a 0 it stays the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

\begin{array}{ccccc}
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
xor &amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\\hline
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\
\end{array}


&lt;p&gt;
What can we do with this? For one thing, image processing. Students
frequently play with images where each pixel is represented as a 24
bit color. Three bytes, one each for red, green, and blue. Each byte
is really 8 bits. We can use bitwise operations on the binary digits
to turn on or off color.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's say we have this rgb triple: (200, 15, 80) which in hexadecimal
is C8 0F 50 or 10111000 00001111 01010000 in binary. If we want to
turn off the reddest reds we could &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; the color with 00001111
11111111 11111111 or 0FFFFF:
&lt;/p&gt;

\begin{array}{cccc}
&amp;amp; 10111000 &amp;amp; 00001111 &amp;amp; 01010000\\
and &amp;amp; 00001111 &amp;amp; 11111111 &amp;amp; 11111111\\\hline
&amp;amp; 00001000 &amp;amp; 00001111 &amp;amp; 01010000\\
\end{array}

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, you could just use the base 10
values and keep on calling color setting and conversion functions but
if you understand binary it's quicker and easier and what's going on
will actually make sense. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course you probably wouldn't write out the binary but would rather
use the hex notation which once a student realizes is just 4 bit
groupings of binary becomes really easy. As a bonus, once you're used
to binary and hex those hexadecimal color values will all of a sudden
make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is just the tip of the image processing and graphics iceberg with
respect to binary. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Related although I haven't played with it myself, I'd imagine you could use
these types of bitwise operations on images to play with
steganography.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Another use of binary is in cybersecurity. Things like buffer
overflows and blowing the stack all make much more sense if you know
how memory is arranged and that's easier to understand if you
understand binary, bytes, and word sizes. I do experiments with my
classes when we use C or C++ where they access arrays off the ends and
end up messing with neighboring variables. It seems like magic unless
you know about memory and to know memory you need to know binary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How about image file formats? Many image file formats start with a
fixed size header. Here's the header definition for the GIF file
format:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"&gt;


&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class="org-right"&gt;

&lt;col class="org-left"&gt;

&lt;col class="org-left"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-right"&gt;Offset&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-left"&gt;Length&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-left"&gt;Contents&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;3  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;"GIF"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;3  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;"87a" or "89a"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;2  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;&amp;lt;Logical Screen Width&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;2  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;&amp;lt;Logical Screen Height&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;1  byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;bit0: Global Color Table Flag (GCTF)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;1..3:  Color&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;Resolution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;4:  Sort&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;Flag to Global Color Table&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;5..7:  Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;of Global Color Table:2&lt;sup&gt;(1+n)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;1  byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;&amp;lt;Background Color Index&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;1  byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;&amp;lt;Pixel Aspect Ratio&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;?  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;&amp;lt;Global Color Table(0..255 x 3 bytes)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;bytes  &amp;lt;Blocks&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;bytes  &amp;lt;Trailer&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;(0x3b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The header info is defined bit by bit so you have to know about binary
and know how to manipulate data on a bit level. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Those were three biggies but there are other places where knowing
binary makes tons of sense:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flag type parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding floating point numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using shifts for quick doubling and halving of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Does this mean that binary has to be or should be in a first course?
No. Should it be somewhere? Certainly and rather than doing binary
because it's on the test or because "you should know it" you can pick
and choose your spots and cover it when it will be fun and interesting
for your kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
JCS's &lt;a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=7414#comment-4045190612"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Irreal today brought me back. It was about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor)"&gt;Brief&lt;/a&gt; which
was the editing hotness back in the day. I played with it a little
really mostly used Emacs clones for real work when I was stuck on
MS-DOS systems. Usually either &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOVE"&gt;JOVE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_(text_editor)"&gt;Epsilon&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the comments Jon reminded me about the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_Toolkit"&gt;MKS Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;
which brought most everyday Unix tools to DOS along with a shell and
a version of Vi. I didn't use Vi much and I only used their shell
until I wrote my own. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking about "rite of passage" projects. I was in
college in the mid to late 80s. It was the heyday of the
IBM-PC. Schools still used older time sharing systems like DEC-20s and
Vaxen but the PC was all the rage. The cool thing about them was that
you had full control and access to the machine and it was simple
enough to get your head around pretty much everything about it. The
downside was that MS-DOS was very limited and of course there was
little to no networking going on. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, you could dive into the low level machine language
stuff very easily. Get Norton's book:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7446489-L.jpg" alt="7446489-L.jpg" align="center" height="250"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and you're on your way. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand many student's graduated with no concept of time
sharing and the ramifications of sharing a system or resources were
foreign to many kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though we always look back to the "good old days," in many ways
things weren't much different. I got a very strong background in
academic CS from NYU (Courant Institute) but just like today, there
was no real preparation for the real world.If you wanted to really develop your
coding chops you had to work on side projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I seem to recall, a typical "rite of passage" side project was writing
your own shell. It didn't have to be anything as powerful as BASH or
ZSH but it would typically be much more powerful than DOS and much
more Unixy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I recall writing my first shell down in UC-49 of Tisch Hall when the
computer labs weren't busy. I wrote it in C which was what the cool
kids used back then. Specifically I used the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Williams_Company"&gt;Let's C&lt;/a&gt; compiler from the
Mark Williams company. This was before Turbo C 2.0 so Let's C was
pretty much the only game in town for a cheap Unix style C compiler
for DOS. There was also Run/C but that was a C interpreter, not a
compiler. I also used that to learn C. Funny story - I certainly
didn't know this at the time but Run/C was written by Peter
Brooks. Peter and I would later meet when he became my colleague at
Stuyvesant teaching CS and I now have the privilege of being able to
call him friend. I joke that I owe him ~ $100 for the interpreter from
back in the day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since this was on DOS, I couldn't do real Unix style pipes like 
&lt;code&gt;cat file | sort | uniq -c | sort -n&lt;/code&gt; but I did simulate it with redirection and temporary
files. It also supported aliases, simple scripts and I think a few
other things. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was pretty happy with it and used it for a couple of years. It was
also one of the first substantial programs I wrote. I learned a lot
from doing it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another "rite of passage" program that was common back then was a
text based window library. Somethig like ncurses that would allow you
to make text based windows and menus on the text only screen. I also
wrote one of these and actually got to use it for a project when I
started working at Goldman. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I guess the third "rite of passage" project I remember was writing a C
compiler but that was different because it was for a class. It was a
significant project but the class didn't really help with writing a
large program in general - it was all about the compiler and all the
theory behind it. Great course but not one in software engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays the projects have changed. Text based windowing is long gone
and while I still think writing a shell is a useful and rewarding
exercise it's not scratching an itch the way it did back when we were
stuck on DOS. I guess writing a full stack web app is probably a
pretty typical one for students these days. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Any others?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="orgeeb0211"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeeb0211"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for
Hunter's incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time
all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be
my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we've come in under three
years. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunter's had a strong but little known undergraduate
CS program for as long as I've known. Much like any program, we've got
our strengths and weaknesses but you go through our program and
academically you'll be as well prepared as from anywhere else. We have some
challenges being a commuter school, a liberal arts school and a school
not commonly thought of for CS but the core has always been there.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunter has been making a concerted effort to up its computer science
game and my joining the team has been part of that. The Daedalus
program is an honors scholarship program. It's similar to the well
known CUNY Macaulay program but it's specific to Hunter and specific to
CS. Our kids get scholarships, laptops, special classes (with me),
activities and events and more. Our first cohort had 12. This past
year we had 23 but a funny thing happened right after we started. Hunter's
Macaulay CS students heard about what was going on and wanted in. The
end result was that last years cohort had a total of 27 students
as we invited the incoming Hunter Macaulay CS students into the
fold. This year, we're up to about 50 total and it looks to be a very
strong group. To be honest I'm a little
scared of growing this quickly. The kids will be great but it will be
a challenge building the community across multiple classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm really pleased with the first two cohorts performance both in
class and out. They're progressing well through the academic program
and are ahead of schedule in terms of internships and outside
activities but I'm even happier that they've been working to level up
Hunter CS as a whole. They started a once a week Dojo last year where
all Hunter CS students could hang out and work on tech projects and
have a speaker series on tap for this coming year. For my part, I've
got a couple of new ideas up my sleeve but I'm going to keep them
under wraps for now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Three years ago Hunter wasn't so much on the map for CS inclined high
school students and while there's much work to be done, many of our
incoming cohort members chose us over other programs that have
traditionally been considered CS strongholds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, our efforts to connect Hunter CS to the NY Tech community have begun to
raise our profile on the other end of the pipeline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's still a long rode ahead but I thought I'd give myself a day to
look back on how far we've come in a short time. Having a great public college option for CS
education is critical for NYC. This was one of the things I left Stuy to
accomplish and we're well on our way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6ae8c83"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I replied this tweet yesterday and thought I'd expound a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We started kids using scheme on 10th grade at stuy so did recursion early. Not everyone got all of it but it think it made things much easier for those that you more CS later.&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/1001508028439519233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We introduced recursion very early in our intro course at Stuy and I
think it worked well. In that course we started by using Racket (nee
Scheme) as the first programming unit. Originally we
started the kids out first using NetLogo or StarLogo and followed with
Scheme but after a few years we switched the order.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wouldn't always recommend Scheme for a first course and in fact
frequently don't but given how the Stuy course was introduced and
developed it made sense and worked. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Was it worth doing things this way? I think so. Prior to that intro
course becoming a requirement I got to see students coming in from
different pathways to APCS. Some came in raw with zero formal
experience, some self taught, some through that intro course and some
having taken another more traditional intro programming course or
experience. The kids who started on Scheme had no more difficulty
mastering loops and iteration but had an easier time getting to the
more advanced recursive techniques. This wasn't a surprise - it wasn't
their first rodeo. This also jived with reports I read at the time
that felt that when students did recursion first, iteration was just
as easy but when they did iteration first, recursion was harder. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can of course make a strong case that recursion isn't necessary
for a kid that isn't going to study more CS. I'll merely argue that
what we did at Stuy worked with that population and I wouldn't change
it. At the same time, I've helped a number of teachers design classes and programs
where we agreed that recursion first was not the way to go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any event, it wasn't that I specifically wanted to do recursion
early but rather, there were a number of things I wanted to do with
the class for which Scheme made sense and recursion was just one of
them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some reasons to like (or for some, to dislike) Scheme early:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's functional – everything is a function. While this is
technically not true, we can fudge it a bit at this level. You put
things in parens so instead of add(a,b) you write (add a b) or
really (+ a b). You can also do (+ a b c). Things that would be
statements are also functions: (if Booelean TruePart FalsePart) is the &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt;
statement. For example &lt;code&gt;(if (&amp;gt;= a b) a b)&lt;/code&gt; returns the larger of a
and b.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it's functional it avoids the issue kids have with &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; being
for assignment rather than comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has great support for list processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recursion is much more natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a super simple language with simple rules and a simple, small  syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, Scheme isn't perfect and some people dislike the above
reasons. It's also easy to come up with a number of other good reasons
not to use a language like Scheme. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the recursion front, it makes things much easier. There are no
loops so recursion develops as a natural form for repetition:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
	    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This defines a function that takes one parameter and returns
&lt;code&gt;x*(x-1)*(x-2)...&lt;/code&gt;. It repeats, but never ends. This leads to adding
a base case:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;lt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Which is your basic factorial function.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since this use of recursion for repetition  develops naturally as we
introduce language concepts it's easier for kids to get their heads
around it as opposed to when they've seen loops already and have an
"easier" alternative. You can make the case that you could introduce
recursion this way in a language with loops like Python but once loops
are available and particularly when loops are idiomatic, students will
find them and getting them to think recursively will be more
difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scheme and most other functional programming languages also have
strong support for lists and list recursion. This means you don't have
to limit yourself to mathy problems. Think about a todo list:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a gallon of milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they have eggs, get a dozen (heh heh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Processing a todo list is really a recursive problem:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the list is empty you're done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the first item off  the list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recurse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once you start working with lists, you can play with all sorts of
recursive examples.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the Scheme unit the big project is creating a sentence
generator. The kids don't know it but they're learning about grammars
and in fact are writing a recursive descent parser - they just think
they're writing a program that creates silly sentences. It's a really
nice project that uses recursion in a way that's different and I'd
argue more fun and interesting than the usual approaches. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I chose Scheme for a variety of reasons. I also chose NetLogo for
specific reasons. Unlike Scheme (or most other popular learning
languages), NetLogo is really all about agent based parallel
processing. There are concepts that we can explore easily and in depth
with NetLogo that would be tremendously difficult in any other
language and at the same time, there are things that are easy to
explore in other languages that Netlogo doesn't lend itself to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, in the end, this post really isn't about when to teach
recursion. It's more about how languages lend themselves to solving
different problems and teaching different concepts in different
ways. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a
nail. Fortunately, we can do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e41e12"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
About a week ago New York State's new regulation creating a &lt;a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers"&gt;K12 CS
teacher certification&lt;/a&gt; went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter"&gt;Matt Flamm&lt;/a&gt; of Crain's New York in a &lt;a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new"&gt;follow up piece&lt;/a&gt;
about it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is &lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt;. In my view, it's a game changer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From a course offerings point of view it's the wild west. I don't mean
this as a bad thing, it's just that there's a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there's a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we're going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People say we'll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I've never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma's call so why can't we find CS teachers? Because we've
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school's math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Having CS certification alone won't woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we'll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won't happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I've hit the sweet
spot with what I've designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don't agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like "APCS - Principles for teachers" or "APCS - A for
teachers."  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we'll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there's a lot more to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3cd7210"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today's the last day of spring break. After the weekend it's back to
the grind. It really hasn't been much of a spring break. The rain and
the snow made for very little spring and between working on the Hunter
/ CUNY2X Internship program and reviewing applications for my Hunter
Daedalus CS Honors program there has been very little break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today was no exception - I spent much of the day working but I did
take a few hours to head over to Cornell Tech on Roosevelt
Island. Why? To check out the &lt;a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/events/cornell-high-school-programming-contest"&gt;Cornell High School Progrmaming
Contest&lt;/a&gt; - first time in NYC.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was invited by my friend and organizer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/diane_levitt"&gt;Diane Levitt&lt;/a&gt;. I only stayed
for an hour or so but it was shaping up to be a great event. It looked
like around a hundred kids from maybe a dozen or so schools and it was
run simultaneously with high schoolers on the Ithaca campus where the
competition has been running for a few years. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The format was similar to other high school programming competitions
I've been to. Teams of two or three sharing a single computer to solve
a number of programming problems that varied in difficulty. You can
check out a few "warm up" problems on the competition &lt;a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/events/cornell-high-school-programming-contest"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The competition reminded me of the &lt;a href="https://www.sjcny.edu/long-island/academics/programs-departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/programming-competition"&gt;St. Joseph's High School
Programming Competition&lt;/a&gt; held every spring but in NYC so more
convenient for city dwellers. I went to the St. Joseph's competition a
few times and I'm a big fan. I particularly like the awards luncheon
after the competition. If I were to make one suggestion to the
organizers there it would be to mix the seating at the luncheon so
that kids get to sit with and spend time with kids from different
schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These competitions contrast nicely with hackathons like &lt;a href="http://stuyhacks.com/%0A"&gt;StuyHacks&lt;/a&gt;
for which I acted as a judge a couple of months ago. Competitions are, well,
competitive. Hackathons can be but don't have to be. Competitions are
about solving problems, hackathons, building things. Each can speak to
a different kind of student. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Both competitions and hackathons have problems as well. On the competition
side we have:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schools with more developed CS programs dominate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single strong student can carry a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some kids don't like or do well in the competitive environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And on the hackathon side:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24 hours of straight work is just a bad idea and a bad thing to
encourage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big advantage to teams that bring prefab code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big advantage to kids with experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Both types of events are great opportunities for young
programmers. They're celebrate academic work, bring tech kids together
as a community and when done right are
something of a CS party. Neither type of event speaks to all kids so
it's great to have both competitions and hackathons to go along with
other types of events available for our kids. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another thing I love abut the Cornell and St, Joseph's competitions
along with StuyHacks is that they're open to all schools and hence all
students. There's room for the novice and also the expert and you
don't have to be in a particular school or program to participate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are other events beyond these three. There are online
competitions like &lt;a href="http://www.usaco.org/"&gt;the USACO&lt;/a&gt;, competitions on HackerRank and Topcoder,
&lt;a href="http://halite.io"&gt;Halite&lt;/a&gt; along with it's hackathon which is great but specialized and in
person ones that are farther away like the &lt;a href="http://pclassic.org/%0A"&gt;PClassic&lt;/a&gt; in Philidelphia
and Rowan's &lt;a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/rupc/%0A"&gt;HS programming competition&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey but it's great to
see great local opportunities like these emerging and hopefully
running for years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/04/thoughts-on-where-cs-education-tools.html"&gt;CS education tools&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. I've
also been meaning to write on the topic but from a different point of
view.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world
both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That's not
really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work
on I'll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent
technology. Over December, I wanted to write an application viewer to
use for company / student internship matching. I started by looking at
&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; but ended up using &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/"&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt; which I liked much more for a variety
of reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The viewer served it's purpose but I think it can be turned into a
much more comprehensive student / employer internship platform. I
tried to steal a few minutes over this past week's spring break to
start a rewrite using another toolset, Clojure, Clojurescript and
Reagent. I'm really liking the Clojure stack and using
Emacs and Cider for the IDE is really blowing me away. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I've noticed is that for every new language of framework you also
have to learn a whole set of ancillary tools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It didn't used to be that way. Back in the day, things were much
simpler. I remembering doing work at Goldman Sachs, it was as simple
as typing something on the command line like &lt;code&gt;cc file1.c file2.c
file3.c&lt;/code&gt;. I of course had to be cutting edge and use fancy modern
tools like &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/"&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt;. What's more, the tools I used in industry were very
similar to what I used in college. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We now live in very different times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you go to the getting started guides for React or Vue it's pretty easy to
get hello world up and running but beyond that you start to fall in to
the Javascript tooling hole. To start you need either &lt;b&gt;npm&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;yarn&lt;/b&gt;
just to manage packages and dependencies. Then you need a build system
or bundler like &lt;b&gt;webpack&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;browserify&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;parcel&lt;/b&gt; and that's not even
considering older options like &lt;b&gt;gulp&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;grunt&lt;/b&gt; and ancillary tools
like &lt;b&gt;babel&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A typical React or Vue project is going to need a &lt;a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter/blob/master/package.json"&gt;project.json&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js"&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;/a&gt; file and sometimes some other files as well. Check
out the links. They're from a simple project template I found
online. Far from simple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I was playing with Vue.js a couple of months ago, I ended up
using Webpack to convert the source code into the final JS, take care
of live-reloading, and in general manage the project. I still have no
idea how most of it works. I don't know if it's just me but I'm very
uncomfortable relying on tools that I really don't fully understand to
build my systems. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Clojure world is little better with Leiningen and Boot. If you
don't believe me, try to make heads or tails of &lt;a href="https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-template/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/figwheel/project.clj"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While it's true that as a professional you'll likely use one set of
tools on a day to day basis and you'll eventually get to know them
that doesn't mean it's not a good idea to prepare kids for what's to
come.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
On the K12 side we have drag and drop languages, specialized learning
IDEs like BlueJ, simple cut down IDEs like Dr Racket and completely
online environments like repl.it. All great starter tools that
insulate beginners from the complexities to come. College's
might get closer to the "real world" but just a tad. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Don't get me wrong, I like many of the tools used in K12
classes and there's far too much complexity in the professional world to
throw at beginners. If we look at a student's entire school
career, classes are already so packed with material it would be hard to
really prepare kids for the real world within their classes. You could
take that tried and true teacher / professor technique of just
requiring it and having the kids figure it out on their own but that's
really just downright abusive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't have an answer for this one. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have my kids use tools like Git and GitHub early along with using
testing frameworks and external libraries. I also try to move my
students to a general purpose programmable platform like Emacs or
Vim. I think these are sound practices but students will still have a
big learning curve when they finally get to industry. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I really would love it to see the tooling become simpler and
documentation better. &lt;a href="https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel"&gt;Parcel&lt;/a&gt;, a Javascript bundler is one of the newer
kids on the block and is much simpler and cleaner than alternatives
like Webpack. The new version of Clojure has it's own command line
tool which is also simpler than the alternatives. Maybe we are already
moving in the right direction and this entire rant will become moot in a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org50339e5"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org50339e5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's so much to like in the shape drawing lessons I talked about
in my &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring/"&gt;refactoring&lt;/a&gt; post that I thought I'd share a little more here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It can be argued that the most important things for a program to do is work. The
most clever, elegant, creative program is worthless if it doesn't
produce the desired result. All too often, beginners and hot shot beginners in particular try to
be too clever too early and get themselves into trouble. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When doing the shape drawing lessons the first couple of shape are
pretty easy
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;

| ****            |    | *               |
| ****            |    | **              |
| ****            |    | ***             |
| ****            |    | ****            |
| ****            |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
but things get more interesting with the right justified triangle:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
----*       *
---**      **
--***     ***
-****    ****
*****   *****

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For this triangle, students want to come up with the formula for the
number of spaces. They usually figure out something like this with
&lt;code&gt;h-i-1&lt;/code&gt; spaces and &lt;code&gt;i+1&lt;/code&gt; stars:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"-"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The formulas become harder to figure out as the shapes become more
complex and sometimes students get stymied.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that while they're struggling to find the perfect
solution, it's sometimes better to do it the dumb way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Consider drawing a trapezoid like this example of height 5 and
starting width 12:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
************
 **********
  ********
   ******
    ****
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A student could come up with the "formulas" for spaces and stars but
sometimes there's a more straightforward way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Consider the number of spaces on each line on the left hand side of
the shape. First line is 0 then 1, 2 etc. Why not start a variable
&lt;code&gt;spaces&lt;/code&gt; at 0 and increment it on each loop iteration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the number of stars, it's starting at the width and being reduced
by 2 each time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This leads to a solution similar to this (using the line routine from
the earlier refactoring post):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;trap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;spaces&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;spaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;" "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;spaces&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;spaces&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This solution is simple to construct, simple to understand, and quite
frankly, hard to get wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It can also lead a student to discovering a pattern or "formula" such
as what was used to solve the earlier problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This might seem to some as a cheap way out, the dumb approach -
creating extra variables and have them count along the way but I
don't. There's nothing wrong with simple and straightforward. Yes, you
could come up with an elegant formula but the bottom line is you need
something to count 0,1,2,3… so create a variable to do it. You need
something to count 12,10,8,… create one for that as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 Now, I'm not advocating writing 100 if statements rather than a loop
but I think you get the idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The best solution is one that works and Sometimes the "dumb" approach is the best approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cs</category><category>pedagogy</category><category>software engineering</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/do-it-the-dumb-way/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 12:24:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Refactoring</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-orge6d16aa" class="outline-2"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge6d16aa"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my laments on teaching computer science is that students are
rarely taught and given the chance to develop  good programming
practices. There's usually not enough time. Beginners work on small
"toys" which don't lend themselves to good software development
practices and later on, there's so much other material like
algorithms, data structures etc. to teach and
learn that programming practices usually amount to lines like:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Make sure to comment your code.."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Indent properly…"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Use functions…"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"It's important to test your code…"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
so when I see an opportunity to use a simple example to drive home a
good practice,  I try to jump on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Drawing shapes with text is a typical early project. I've seen it in
text books and online and have been doing it for years. I recall doing
it back in the 80s in Fortran IV when the programs we wrote were on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card"&gt;punch cards&lt;/a&gt;, run
overnight on an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130"&gt;IBM 1130&lt;/a&gt;, and printouts picked up the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice use of nested loops. The students will write functions to
create assorted shapes out of asterisks  like rectangles and
triangles. Typical solutions look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Which results in shapes like these:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;

| ****            |    | *               |
| ****            |    | **              |
| ****            |    | ***             |
| ****            |    | ****            |
| ****            |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
| *************** |    | *               |
| *************** |    | **              |
| *************** |    | ***             |
| *************** |    | ****            |
| *************** |    | *****           |
| *************** |    | ******          |
| *************** |    | *******         |

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then there will be more interesting shapes including things like:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;

   *       *            *****
  **      ***           *   *            and more
 ***     *****          *   *
****      ***           *****
           *   

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a great time to talk about refactoring.  All of the shape
drawing functions follow the same pattern - there's an outer loop for
the height and then one or more inner loops to draw each line. We can
factor out the inner loops in to a separate &lt;code&gt;line()&lt;/code&gt; function.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;----- This can be factored out&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;                                 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;---------------- along with this&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;                               &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's just like factoring in algebra:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="LATEX"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(RectangleOuterLoop × Line) + (TriangleOuterLoop × Line) ⇒ Line  (Rectangleouterloop × TriangleOuterloop)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We end up with:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
It's simpler, cleaner, and also can lead us to thinking about the
"harder" shapes in an interesting way. Instead of looking at the right
justified triangle as a triangle, we can think of each level as two
lines - one of spaces (shown here as dashes) followed by a line of
stars:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
----*       *
---**      **
--***     ***
-****    ****
*****   *****

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Noticing that  for a height of 5, the dashed lines count down in
length 4,3,2,1,0 and the star lines count up 1,2,3,4,5, we get:
