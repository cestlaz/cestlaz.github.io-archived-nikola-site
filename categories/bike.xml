&lt;p&gt;Love the city - it's walkable, lots of good food, love the waterfront,
history, and lots to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love seeing a city using a bike/walking combo. In a car, you
speed by things too fast and parking's always a problem. Foot alone
doesn't let you cover enough ground. By bike, you're slow enough to
see things but fast enough to get from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we brought our own bikes for the trip. These time, we used
the Bixi bike share. Here are some thoughts comparing their system
with our Citibike system. It's not really a fair comparison. In NY I
use it alone for shopping and meetings and in Montreal, it was a
family of 4 tourists. Still, I found some things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Our trips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first day, we rode from our place to the &lt;a href="http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden"&gt;Botanical
Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. Between 7 and
8 kilometers. They had a pretty amazing exhibition going on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img width="40%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-08-15-Bikeshares-Citibike-vs-Bixi/montreal-2.jpg" class="" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we brought our own bikes. The biggest
difference - we didn't have to schlep locks. Maybe not a big deal if
you're taking little piddly locks, but when you're taking
&lt;a href="http://www.abus.com/eng/Mobile-Security/Bike-safety-and-security/Locks/Lock-chain-combination/CityChain-1010"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://www.kryptonitelock.com/Pages/ProductInformation.aspx?PNumber=999492"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;
it's a big deal. It's really nice to be able take a bike and not have
to carry anything else, even though we did bring our own helmets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, between the time it took to check out all four
bikes, a leisurely pace, and the timing of traffic lights, the ride
took about 50 minutes. That meant that we had to swap out bikes once
in the middle and wait two minutes between. Not a huge deal, but a
little annoying. The 45 minutes that subscribers of both systems get
seems to be a much sweeter spot. I know, 50 minutes is still more than
45, but at 30, by the time we check out four bikes and are ready to
go, the first bike already has almost 5 minutes on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second day, we took the bikes down to the waterfront and
spent most of the day there. It was about a 17 minute ride. At the end
of the day, we decided to wend our way back to the apartment on foot
to see more of the neighborhoods - something we couldn't do if we
brought our own bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Issues and annoyances&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem we had, was lack of internet. Without internet, you can't
use the mobile app to find bike and docks. This turned out not to be
too much of a problem as Montreal seems to be saturated with Bixi
stations but it was a concern if we wanted to venture to more fringe
areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem was that there seemed to be a number of broken
docks. They were full, but the kiosk was non-responsive. This led to a
dual problem -- finding a place to dock your bike and taking another
bike out. This hit us twice, but fortunately, nearby docks were
working with bikes and docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third problem, and this one I never would have thought about before,
is that the Montreal bikes have shorter seat posts than the NY
bikes. This is actually a big deal. I'm about 5'10" with short limbs
and at maximum height, the bikes were too short. My son's legs are
longer. Neither of us are giants. This made for a less comfortable and
slower ride. I guess people might not notice -- even in NY I always
see people on rentals and Citibikes with their seats too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still love my Bike Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm also liking this bike share touring thing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bike</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-08-15-Bikeshares-Citibike-vs-Bixi.md/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2013 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Rest of the Trip</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-08-15-rest-of-trip.html/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for the rest of the trip.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rome to &lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Little&lt;/span&gt; Falls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had some trouble getting out of Rome. As always, once we're on trail, it's pretty easy to follow, but entering and leaving towns and cities, with the exceptions of canal side towns like Lockport, can be a challenge. During the day, we found that we could either follow the official Erie Canal Trail signs or the pink trail blazes painted on the streets for the Erie Canal Tour (that preceded us by a week). As we get to towns, the blazes are of little use since they lead to rest stops and camp sites rather than through. We also had the &lt;a href="http://www.ptny.org/guidebook/index.shtml"&gt;Cycling the Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; book. It's terrific and I recommend it to anyone riding the canal. It does, however, have one problem. When the path is on the road, it doesn't actually name the road (rather, it superimposes the path line). This made getting out of Rome a chore. Fortunately, we only added one mile to our day before we found our way out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving town we saw Rome's beautifully restored train station:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSElnvuA5I/AAAAAAAAGBo/8xS2pUIxkuY/s1600/IMG_20100812_085625.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSElnvuA5I/AAAAAAAAGBo/8xS2pUIxkuY/s200/IMG_20100812_085625.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSEmflCK-I/AAAAAAAAGBw/_196cSQpiFo/s1600/IMG_20100812_085634.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSEmflCK-I/AAAAAAAAGBw/_196cSQpiFo/s200/IMG_20100812_085634.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Also, the Fort Herkimer Church:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSE8s3YozI/AAAAAAAAGCA/04I7vpST8K8/s1600/IMG_20100812_145416.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSE8s3YozI/AAAAAAAAGCA/04I7vpST8K8/s320/IMG_20100812_145416.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of the ride was relatively uneventful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spent the night in Little Falls. Stayed in the "Canal Side Inn," a small in with three rooms. Our's was both huge and gorgeous.  It has a connected restaurant. Fine French/American fare. Everything on the menu looked delicious, but after a day of riding, it was a little much. They also had a less expensive, less elaborate grill menu with items like Steak Frites, or scrod in an almond crust served in the lounge. As the lounge was booked, they offered us the grill menu in the main dining room. Food was excellent, including the deserts -- chocolat pot de creme, a meringue filled with strawberries and ice cream, and a blueberry bread pudding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you ever get to Little Falls, eat at the Canal Side Inn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it was time to turn in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles today: 44.5&lt;br&gt;Miles total: 313.5&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Little Falls to Amsterdam:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Little Falls was right next to the canal, leaving town was easy. Just outside of town, we passed the high point of the canal. At the point, a lock with what I think was the canal's largest altitude change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It looked to be another uneventful day. More beautiful views that have become de rigueur and more crushed stone path that was more like biking through sand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It looked like our two most promising lunch spots were at around 15 miles (too early) and 30 miles (too late). At 15 miles, at Canajoharie, we stopped for ice cream:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnOr5elOI/AAAAAAAAGDc/hvji45k5tSk/s1600/IMG_20100813_112629.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnOr5elOI/AAAAAAAAGDc/hvji45k5tSk/s200/IMG_20100813_112629.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was the first time all trip we were able to find mid-day ice cream!!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Canajoharie is another one of those small towns we passed through, but they set up a little information stand right where the trail crosses main street. The young man working there directed us to the ice cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the things that surprised me throughout was the lack of signage at the towns, particularly the small ones. While the traffic on the trail isn't great, a couple of signs pointing to food and refreshments at the trail heads would cost next to nothing and maybe draw a few more people into the towns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refreshed and refueled, we continued on. After lunch at Fultonville, we soldiered on. A few miles out of Amsterdam, we got to the Schoharie crossing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnDTW-NHI/AAAAAAAAGDY/LKb2Ys2kcA0/s1600/IMG_20100813_141549.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnDTW-NHI/AAAAAAAAGDY/LKb2Ys2kcA0/s200/IMG_20100813_141549.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, you can see the remains Schoharie aqueduct from the barge canal in the distance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWmbWf4cZI/AAAAAAAAGDA/QDWBCAZeh_k/IMG_20100813_143044.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWmbWf4cZI/AAAAAAAAGDA/QDWBCAZeh_k/IMG_20100813_143044.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Schoharie crossing is the one location where there are remnants from all renditions of the canal and one can also see the I90, where the bridge collapsed some 20 years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also turns out that this was the site of other historic places:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWl6TsYd9I/AAAAAAAAGC4/Y6QW5D1Wy1c/IMG_20100813_143305.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWl6TsYd9I/AAAAAAAAGC4/Y6QW5D1Wy1c/IMG_20100813_143305.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;We arrived in Amsterdam a short time later. We stayed at the America's Best Value hotel. The only one in town. Looks like new ownership is doing some serious renovations but the rooms were spacious, clean, and nice. BIL Mike and SO Maria live nearby and joined us for dinned. We ate at the on site indian restaurant -- naan and saag paneer -- mmmmm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One more day of riding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles today: 49&lt;br&gt;Miles total: 362.5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amsterdam to Albany:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last day of riding. We estimated about 50 miles. Best lunch possibility was Cohoe s, about 30 miles away. We were hoping to find a snack along the way but figured we'd make it on Nuun and Cliff Bars if needs be. The mileage looked to be formidable, but we also new the whole day would be on paved roads and paved trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving Amsterdam, we saw a couple more historic sites:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Streets through Syracuse, up a few hills towards the outskirts of town. Our directions and actual streets didn't quite jive so we had a little trouble finding our way back to the canal path, but once we did we figured it would be smooth sailing. Most of today was along the "Old Erie Canal State Park." A 36 mile linear park stretching from Syracuse to Rome.  Just about all of it is off road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMyaf2_BuI/AAAAAAAAF_Q/1rBGV1AA_ao/s1600/IMG_20100811_092547.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMyaf2_BuI/AAAAAAAAF_Q/1rBGV1AA_ao/s200/IMG_20100811_092547.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMypRMsDsI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/s7Z3Yysg_ow/s1600/IMG_20100811_093605.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMypRMsDsI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/s7Z3Yysg_ow/s200/IMG_20100811_093605.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 17 miles in we got to Chitenango, birthplace of L. Frank Baum of "Wizard of Oz" fame.  We spent some time at their "Canal Boat Museum." It's on the site where they built and repaired canal boats. They've been working to restore as much of the site as possible. This includes the drydocks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzUgsvXLI/AAAAAAAAF_0/yenDVdU5CRM/s1600/IMG_20100811_110232.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzUgsvXLI/AAAAAAAAF_0/yenDVdU5CRM/s200/IMG_20100811_110232.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzdXQrsdI/AAAAAAAAF_4/93Fxo4k5qEs/s1600/IMG_20100811_111038.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzdXQrsdI/AAAAAAAAF_4/93Fxo4k5qEs/s200/IMG_20100811_111038.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;as well as an 80% sized canal boat they're building:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzp258PPI/AAAAAAAAGAE/W8ALxRligZE/s1600/IMG_20100811_111701.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzp258PPI/AAAAAAAAGAE/W8ALxRligZE/s200/IMG_20100811_111701.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back on the trail, we spotted the remains of sunken canal boat (note the rebar tracing out the boat in the water):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzzx7AVeI/AAAAAAAAGAI/U9pJ0kzMOrs/s1600/IMG_20100811_113100.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzzx7AVeI/AAAAAAAAGAI/U9pJ0kzMOrs/s200/IMG_20100811_113100.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continuing on, there were more locks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMz6iF9UFI/AAAAAAAAGAM/pZ952XKrbQU/s1600/IMG_20100811_144601.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMz6iF9UFI/AAAAAAAAGAM/pZ952XKrbQU/s200/IMG_20100811_144601.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;and bridges:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s1600/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s200/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;After lunch in Canastota, we set out on the second 25ish miles of the day. We found our way back onto the path, the stone dust was fine and even some of the road was paved. This lulled us into a sense of security. About 15 miles into the afternoon ride, we crossed path with what appeared to be a trail resurfacing machine. Not a good thing. The next few miles had us hugging the one good edge of the trail. The rest was soft and full of holes. The whole trail was also full of runs of dirt and gullies. All hazardous to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We struggled through and made it to the outskirts of Rome. We followed the last few miles of path, but the path kept degrading. First to a rocky surface, then to one with pools of water, then to no path at all!!!! Fortunately, there was an outlet to a road nearby. We worked our way to it and followed the roads the rest of the way in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had made it to Rome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s1600/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s200/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After lunch in Canastota, we set out on the second 25ish miles of  the day. We found our way back onto the path, the stone dust was fine  and even some of the road was paved. This lulled us into a sense of  security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After checking into the hotel and a cooling dip in the pool, we walked over to fort Stanwix, dating back to the French and Indian war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1SdeOSiI/AAAAAAAAGA0/c9V03bGaSZs/s1600/IMG_20100811_174126.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1SdeOSiI/AAAAAAAAGA0/c9V03bGaSZs/s320/IMG_20100811_174126.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1lKtcmnI/AAAAAAAAGA4/wiWcHcXk4c0/s1600/IMG_20100811_174156.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1lKtcmnI/AAAAAAAAGA4/wiWcHcXk4c0/s320/IMG_20100811_174156.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinner at the Franklin Hotel (appropriately, Italian food.

Our fifth day in a row of riding. Figured it could be one of the tougher days between the changing terrain and the return of the heat and humidity.  Apparently, there's no shade in northern NY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turned out to be true. The first part of the ride was mostly on road. Easy surface, but up and down.  When we got to the old canal path, it was more gravely than crushed stone. Felt like we were riding through mush.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stopped about 20 mile in for lunch at Jordan. Just about our halfway point of the day and of the trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCC8cTQSwI/AAAAAAAAF9M/FdO1UkNllU8/s1600/IMG_20100809_123907.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCC8cTQSwI/AAAAAAAAF9M/FdO1UkNllU8/s320/IMG_20100809_123907.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike other days when we were able to find nice local eateries, today we hat to resort to a single pizza place. Truth be told, it was pretty good but as the pizzeria was hot, we were actually better off eating at the picnic table in the sun out front. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back on the trail, there were some nice sights, including remnants from the old canal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDAI9Fa2I/AAAAAAAAF9U/3ogAk3MMLVc/s1600/IMG_20100809_123944.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDAI9Fa2I/AAAAAAAAF9U/3ogAk3MMLVc/s320/IMG_20100809_123944.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDBoilDCI/AAAAAAAAF9c/2l4t0kJibyM/s1600/IMG_20100809_124127.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDBoilDCI/AAAAAAAAF9c/2l4t0kJibyM/s320/IMG_20100809_124127.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDDBBAC6I/AAAAAAAAF9g/o-XNCakXEwg/s1600/IMG_20100809_133337.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDF94R9kI/AAAAAAAAF9o/1lEr5AnU7lo/s1600/IMG_20100809_135909.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDF94R9kI/AAAAAAAAF9o/1lEr5AnU7lo/s320/IMG_20100809_135909.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;After 42.5 tough miles, we ended up in Syracuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDJjSkSBI/AAAAAAAAF90/edt7IgpzS38/s1600/IMG_20100809_170609.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDJjSkSBI/AAAAAAAAF90/edt7IgpzS38/s320/IMG_20100809_170609.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hearty appetites in tow, we decided to sample Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. Good. Personally, I prefer the burnt ends at Rub and the overall meal at Hill Country, and those are just a couple of blocks from our house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDKYYof0I/AAAAAAAAF94/UOauSrVwiBE/s1600/IMG_20100809_170905.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDKYYof0I/AAAAAAAAF94/UOauSrVwiBE/s320/IMG_20100809_170905.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today was our rest day. Hot and humid -- would have been brutal to ride, but it wasn't a lot of fun walking around town. Not much to tell, just a quiet day. Most things we hoped to see were closed. We did get to the Erie Canal museum -- In the last remaining WeighLock house (sorry, no pictures, accidentally erased what was on my phone). To pay for the original canal as well as it's expansion, tolls were levied on good passing through. To determine the toll, canal boats had to be weighted. At the beginning of each season, weights were determined for each boat. Then, as they moved through the canal, they would enter a weighlock, the water would drain, depositing the boat on a huge wooden cradle which was part of a scale. The boat would be weighed and the toll assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a picture from wikipedia:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG/250px-ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG/250px-ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the road in front -- that used to be the old canal. Other than the weigh lock building and a few other artifacts, there's nary a trace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of the day was spent walking around and taking it easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id="goog_725115"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="goog_725116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGGRUAoj4bI/AAAAAAAAF-Y/ylZymwTXCrI/s1600/IMG_20100810_110327.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGGRUAoj4bI/AAAAAAAAF-Y/ylZymwTXCrI/s320/IMG_20100810_110327.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles from the previous day: 42.5&lt;br&gt;Total: 219.5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow: All roads lead to Rome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7077795059789910778?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bike</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-08-10-nothing-to-see-here.html/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Day 5</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-08-09-day-5.html/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GwanbIJI/AAAAAAAAF78/MLoPnvKbGP8/s1600/IMG_20100808_162329.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GwanbIJI/AAAAAAAAF78/MLoPnvKbGP8/s200/IMG_20100808_162329.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Angel 1: What are the Zamansky's doing next to that bridge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angel 2: Maybe they're pondering if their lives have had any meaning in this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GuQHtPYI/AAAAAAAAF70/tF5-5yU-KZM/s1600/IMG_20100808_162143.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GuQHtPYI/AAAAAAAAF70/tF5-5yU-KZM/s200/IMG_20100808_162143.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angel 1: Do you think we should send Clarence to straighten them out? He seemed to do a good job&lt;br&gt; the last time we had a troubled person on that bridge. He even earned his wings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angel 2: I don't know, maybe they're just trying to decide on where to go to dinner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep there we were, on the bridge in Bedford, I mean Seneca Falls. The bridge and town that was purportedly used as a model for Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life." But how did we get there? Maybe we should start at the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We left our intrepid adventurers last night in Palmyra. After posting, we went to look at the Joseph Smith farm and Sacred Grove, passing the Mormon Temple and Church along the way. This morning after breakfast with what appeared to be a number of "pilgrims" getting ready to worship, we set off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Requisite pretty pictures here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GbuC2jRI/AAAAAAAAF6s/DOE-e3hEtsU/s1600/IMG_20100808_084313.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GbuC2jRI/AAAAAAAAF6s/DOE-e3hEtsU/s320/IMG_20100808_084313.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gdo0lQjI/AAAAAAAAF60/_UQzuQEElRw/s1600/IMG_20100808_090932.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gdo0lQjI/AAAAAAAAF60/_UQzuQEElRw/s320/IMG_20100808_090932.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passing through all the "port" towns, each with the canal neatly manicured. Straight banks and a narrow channel it's easy to forget that the whole project tied together a number of NY waterways. At points like in the above picture, it's much wider and the banks much more natural.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We stopped at a hotel in Newark NY for the facilities. Natan noticed this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Ge7sl-wI/AAAAAAAAF64/qDhPqccIY5o/s1600/IMG_20100808_093354.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Ge7sl-wI/AAAAAAAAF64/qDhPqccIY5o/s320/IMG_20100808_093354.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The sign instructs to flush up for liquid waste, down for solid. We decided not to ask. Tim, I don't know if you read this blog, but I think you had a story about this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there we moved from the canal path to the road. After a few miles on Bike Route 5, we ended up in Clyde. Ate at  "Brickoven" a restaurant that used to be an industrial bakery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GmIMCBmI/AAAAAAAAF7Q/yHwo-nhIkas/s1600/IMG_20100808_120721.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GmIMCBmI/AAAAAAAAF7Q/yHwo-nhIkas/s200/IMG_20100808_120721.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gm1qODcI/AAAAAAAAF7U/fHQDToHPSgM/s1600/IMG_20100808_121016.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gm1qODcI/AAAAAAAAF7U/fHQDToHPSgM/s200/IMG_20100808_121016.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Perfect stop for lunch. The corned beef hash I had wasn't great -- tasted like canned. Maybe that's just coming off of the hash I had at the diner in Tonowanda which was truly exceptional. Everything else was terrific and the staff and clientèle as friendly as could be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there it was on route 414 until we got to Seneca Falls. We did some road riding on our first day, but this was our most extensive. We had some stretches of six foot shoulders, but some of three and some of none. Since the roads weren't that busy it wasn't too nerve wracking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interesting though, to see how motorists treat you. Most motorists made attempts to slow down and shift at least partly into the neighboring lane (where oncoming traffic sometimes made this impossible). Every now and then, however, a car would blow by right next to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I particularly noticed a three car caravan that whooshed passed us. The first and third cars were no surprise -- a big honkin SUV and a red sports car. The car in the middle was an ice cream truck -- you know the kind. The small ones that park on a street corner to dispense Good Humor Bars. Complete with those big SLOW &lt;br&gt;emblems on it. In all fairness to the SUV's most of them gave us wide berth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty two miles after we started, we ended up in Seneca Falls. It's noted for a number of things including the women's rights movement. There are a number of plaques noting important achievements of women including Amelia Bloomer, Elizbeth Cady Stanton, and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We walked part of the town, passing the church where the first equal rights amendment was proposed:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gp3rMNBI/AAAAAAAAF7g/rzvdjzcfzvY/s1600/IMG_20100808_160404.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gp3rMNBI/AAAAAAAAF7g/rzvdjzcfzvY/s200/IMG_20100808_160404.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cayuga - Seneca canal:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GsM2bj7I/AAAAAAAAF7o/X011uG3IO4s/s1600/IMG_20100808_160908.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GsM2bj7I/AAAAAAAAF7o/X011uG3IO4s/s200/IMG_20100808_160908.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;And a neat sculpture garden:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GzUgyfgI/AAAAAAAAF8I/RNJ9VVTDJuI/s1600/IMG_20100808_164257.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GzUgyfgI/AAAAAAAAF8I/RNJ9VVTDJuI/s200/IMG_20100808_164257.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;After dinner, we walked back to our inn.

If we felt good, we'd try to push on to Pittsford. We were pretty excited when we saw:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bq2SnbiI/AAAAAAAAF4k/W9G8ttVDbyY/s1600/IMG_20100807_110404.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bq2SnbiI/AAAAAAAAF4k/W9G8ttVDbyY/s320/IMG_20100807_110404.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the entire canal path in Rochester is in park so we rode right through without thinking about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At mile 25, we finally stopped for lunch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bwf-vA1I/AAAAAAAAF4w/Ew0Nbh5fpGM/s1600/IMG_20100807_135634.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bwf-vA1I/AAAAAAAAF4w/Ew0Nbh5fpGM/s200/IMG_20100807_135634.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bt-HHKpI/AAAAAAAAF4o/siPLwYGbn14/s1600/IMG_20100807_122959.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bt-HHKpI/AAAAAAAAF4o/siPLwYGbn14/s200/IMG_20100807_122959.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pittsford has a nice little park right on the canal. A Bike shop, a couple of other shops, and a few restaurants. We wanted to try the Crepe place, but long lines led us to a third day of medeteranian food. Not bad, and a pretty view of the canal. Besides, since we were eating outdoors, we didn't even have to lock up the bkes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were making much better time than our first two days, but today was a tough one for Batya. She just felt weak all day. On top of that, porta-potties were at a premium. Throughout the trip, we've been surprised by the cleanliness of the porta-potties on the canal route. We've been equally surprised by the irregularity of their spacing. Some times they're at every lift bridge, some time much further apart. Today, there was nothing from shortly after we set out up until lunch. In the afternoon, Batya was ecstatic to find:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B1InLm1I/AAAAAAAAF44/qir0aRS0BUs/s1600/IMG_20100807_135818.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B1InLm1I/AAAAAAAAF44/qir0aRS0BUs/s320/IMG_20100807_135818.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Other than the scenic ride, not too much today en route. We did see the lift bridge in Fairport. It's unique in that it has no right angles and that  the two banks are at different levels:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B3fc-ddI/AAAAAAAAF48/6hICJZhzRmk/s1600/IMG_20100807_141325.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B3fc-ddI/AAAAAAAAF48/6hICJZhzRmk/s200/IMG_20100807_141325.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B71oEcmI/AAAAAAAAF5E/ryLc7yfOgPk/s1600/IMG_20100807_144322.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B71oEcmI/AAAAAAAAF5E/ryLc7yfOgPk/s200/IMG_20100807_144322.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We also saw: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm also continually amazed at the design and engineering of the canal. We got to one of the locks just as it was about to go into action.

Right now it's down. It's raised when a boat has to pass under. Back in the day, as there was much less road traffic, the bridges stayed in the raised position so boats and barges could pass. Stairways took pedestrians to the raised pathway to cross at any time. The bridge only had to be lowered when vehicular traffic had to cross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire day was spent right along the canal providing for some very pleasant scenery:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4xygAZGI/AAAAAAAAF1k/XywYlgzeKsk/s1600/IMG_20100806_100916.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4xygAZGI/AAAAAAAAF1k/XywYlgzeKsk/s200/IMG_20100806_100916.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4z6cIbzI/AAAAAAAAF1s/zRr1S0R9nfU/s1600/IMG_20100806_100926.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4z6cIbzI/AAAAAAAAF1s/zRr1S0R9nfU/s200/IMG_20100806_100926.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And more lift bridges:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5Vr6PplI/AAAAAAAAF2g/OzKoBz7N-9E/s1600/IMG_20100806_114638.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5Vr6PplI/AAAAAAAAF2g/OzKoBz7N-9E/s200/IMG_20100806_114638.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crossing a canal aqueduct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5nDHKxyI/AAAAAAAAF24/tq79--D6TM0/s1600/IMG_20100806_120451.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5nDHKxyI/AAAAAAAAF24/tq79--D6TM0/s200/IMG_20100806_120451.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And here, this aqueduct is the only point at which a road passes under the canal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then to the northern most point of the canal:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5s7inxZI/AAAAAAAAF3E/4AFrM93O61E/s1600/IMG_20100806_125455.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5s7inxZI/AAAAAAAAF3E/4AFrM93O61E/s320/IMG_20100806_125455.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 22 or so miles in, we stopped at Albion for lunch. After riding around the historic downtown and seeing the cobblestone buildings, we stopped at a coffee shop  for lunch, picking up one of their famous SchnickleFritz cookies for a snack later on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5yTNhabI/AAAAAAAAF3Q/XtOREP7EnA0/s1600/IMG_20100806_135549.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5yTNhabI/AAAAAAAAF3Q/XtOREP7EnA0/s200/IMG_20100806_135549.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's another lift bridge -- in the up position this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5405ItnI/AAAAAAAAF3g/emvsi1zcnYc/s1600/IMG_20100806_135700.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5405ItnI/AAAAAAAAF3g/emvsi1zcnYc/s320/IMG_20100806_135700.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This lift bridge was the sight of a circus stunt gone terribly awry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making it to Holley NY, we realized that we've actually covered a fair amount of ground:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx57bl8e0I/AAAAAAAAF3k/_H-kmQQq94M/s1600/IMG_20100806_151036.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx57bl8e0I/AAAAAAAAF3k/_H-kmQQq94M/s320/IMG_20100806_151036.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was at a park that had a really nice waterfall, but alas, I don't have a shot worthy of sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there five more miles to Brockport, the Victorian Inn, showers and dinner at a Greek restaurant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mileage for the day: 47&lt;br&gt;Total: 85&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This beats both our touring one day total of 42 from McKeesport PA to Connelsville, PA and two day touring total: Mkeesport PA to Ohiopyle PA, 58 miles. It doesn't beat our top day which was 88 miles -- the NY Century (75 mile ride plus an extra 13 afterwards).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow to Palmyra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-2060842584962667541?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bike</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-08-06-lockport-to-brockport.html/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
