Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of &lt;a href="http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/"&gt;Navajo Math Circles&lt;/a&gt;, a
documentary on a &lt;a href="http://www.mathcircles.org/"&gt;Math Circle&lt;/a&gt; put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I'm most familiar with the &lt;a href="https://www.nymathcircle.org/"&gt;New York Math Circle&lt;/a&gt;. I'm friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As someone who's worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they've started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what's
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it's something
we're losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
"making the work interesting and relevant to the student" but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what's the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Math Circle is fun!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that says it all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son's best teachers, &lt;a href="http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx"&gt;Paula Rogovin&lt;/a&gt; did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Until we win back public education it's important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
&lt;a href="http://cstuy.org"&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;) and it's also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't been teaching this past semester. That's why I haven't been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt; recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it's locked in the Facebook silo. I've got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let's focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; wrote a bit about it on his blog &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox based solutions
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emailing projects
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
or other repository hosting services
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Interesting enough, I've gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I keep hearing "the kids will copy from each other" or something like
that. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As Alfred said in his post: "Students have been copying from
classmates for years."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we've
been teaching CS and they'll be doing it for years to come. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using a hidden submission system doesn't help and could hurt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a win all around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what do I do on the cheating front?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I'll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
GitHub also gives tools that help. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the GitHub graph for a project:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/github-graph.png" alt="github-graph.png" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs – what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Technology isn't going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don't stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some good points in the Facebook comments on my &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.Vy5aAd9vH0o"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;. One notable
comment was the fact that many teachers wouldn't be able to gain the
traction needed to teach CS without an AP designation. This is true
but also sad that we've awarded such educational authority to a
private company that's accountable to no one. Schools should run
courses because they're good for kids not specifically because they're
AP.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stuyvesant just implemented a policy that every student has to take at
least one AP class to graduate and that now every student in an AP
class has to take the AP exam. There's also been a push for Stuy to
run APCS Principles in spite of the fact that the current home grown
intro course is superior.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These policies and pushes at Stuy are purely for the sake of ratings
and in no way for the benefit of the student.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But let's imagine a world without the college board.  To do this we're
going to have to take off our computer science hats and look at
another, more established high school subject area - mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, setting the stage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's the mid 1990's. High school students across the nation are taking
math classes. Some are even taking calculus. This makes the College
Board happy since they offer two AP Calculus exams. But the College
Board notices that many students aren't ready for calculus. To fill
this gap, they create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Statistics"&gt;AP Statistics&lt;/a&gt;. First offered in 1997 to 7,667
students it was given to almost 200,000 students last year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to wikipedia, the course was created to give an AP
mathematics option for students not ready for calculus. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't seem to recall any huge demand for an AP statistics course but
it was created and adopted. It turned into one of the fastest growing
AP classes and a nice money maker for the college board. I don't know
how the class was pushed or perceived in other schools but at Stuy it
was seen as a way to get an easy AP math course on the
transcript. Before any statisticians get the torches and pitchforks -
I'm just relaying the student perception. I haven't looked into the
course sufficiently to form an opinion on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, let's imagine a world without the College Board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An individual school would look at it's students needs and decide if
they needed an additional math course. Maybe they'd conclude that what they
were doing was fine or maybe they would conclude that a new class was
needed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If they decided they needed a new advanced course the school would
either have the expertise to create it in house or they'd probably
turn to the local college or university for guidance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They might end up with a course very similar to AP Statistics or they
might end up with something very different. They might
end up with another class like Discrete Math or they might end up
partnering with the college and having students take classes there. In
all cases, since math teachers generally have a pretty good math
backgroud, schools could make good decisions and design sound
educational experiences for their kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of these seem to be better results for the students than blindly
following the College Board - keeping
education and education decisions local.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about CS?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I admit that's a tougher nut to crack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most schools generally don't currently have the in house expertise
needed to build their own solutions or even to really critically judge
what's out there. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That said, even if you need join the cult of the College Board to get
your school to run some CS you can:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab all the materials you can find - those labeled AP and those not
labeled AP.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't bother with AP Syllabus certification. Teach what you think is
best. Designate the class as honors to differentiate them from other
classes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with your local college and tech sector. They're not high
school educators but they are valuable resources.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unrelated side note - be wary of code schools - most don't really
have any educational chops.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't force kids to sit for the exams and only encourage them to do
so if the exam will likely do something for the kid.  
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that's it or my College Board rants.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then again, I also thought that when I wrote Friday's post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/world-without-college-board/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 21:07:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Advanced Placement - Because We Don't Trust Teachers</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/college-board/"&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook
hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don't trust our
high school teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I usually use phrases like "society doesn't trust" but let's
personalize it this time – for parents, think about whether or not you trust your
kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization
more?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you teach an advanced placement course, in order for your class to
be listed as AP you have to submit your syllabus to the college board
for approval. This sounds like they're setting a standard but it's
not. I can point to a bunch of teachers who have submitted identical syllabi
where sometimes it's accepted but ofttimes it's rejected. This is the
syllabus we submitted originally for Stuy. Yes, we have high achieving
kids, but given the fact that the syllabus was approved originally and
that Stuy students just about all score 4 or 5 on APCS-A should tell
you something about the level of care or competence of the College
Board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then you teach the class and in May, one to two months before the end
of the semester the kids take the AP exam - you don't see results
until the summer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In theory, if the kids do well they can receive placement or
credit. The problem is, fewer and fewer schools are giving credit,
when they do, it might not help due to the way undergrads pay for
courses and placement can generally be achieved by appealing to
college departments or by taking college administered placements.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back to the trust thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In college, you take a course, the final exam is created by the
professor or a group of professors and it's graded by the people that
teach the course - possibly as a committee. Kids final grades include
these exams but a student can fail a final or even miss one and still
pass the class whereas an AP exam is a one shot deal and even if you
"pass" you might not get anything from it. I'm not even getting into
questioning the quality and content of the exams. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kids get their grades and college credit. There are no outside
"standardized exams" and we trust that the professors and the colleges
are educating our kids. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, in high school, teachers make their lessons, teach their classes,
create, administer, and grade final exams and kids get grade - but not
for college level classes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know multiple high school physics, chemistry, math, and computer
science teachers who are far better at teaching than their college
counterparts yet my friend the math teacher isn't trusted to assess
his calculus students for the purpose of college credit - we don't
trust him but we trust the faceless entity known as the College
Board. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Think about that for a minute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You trust your child's teacher with your child's well being every
day but you don't trust him to say whether or not your kid knows
calculus?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a real problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have a friend who frequently doesn't quite finish the BC Calculus
test topics because he actually teaches the material in depth –
instead of "follow the scripts" the kids go through proofs and
derivations. It costs the kids - I know a number of them who got a 4
on the BC exam rather than a 5 but come the end of June when the class
is done, they know more calculus more deeply than a lot of kids who've
taken the class in college. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lines of college have been blurred with more and more "remedial"
classes being taught at the college level and more and more "college
level" being taught in the high schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a really sad state of affairs when we trust our professors - many
of whom are hired more for research than for their teaching chops
and we don't trust our teachers during our kids more formative years.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 10:59:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Remember, school is all about profit, wait no, I mean testing, no, I mean...</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/college-board/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
It's important to remember, the college board is about making money
for the college board. It's not about supporting teachers and it's
certainly  not about educating kids.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Kids took the AP Computer Science A exam last week and the College
Board just released the free response questions. There seems to me
more chatter about them in social media than in past years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm just left wondering how AP became the be all and end all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From where I stand, the College Board, who runs AP, SAT, and PSAT
exams is all about making money for the College Board - they're a
non-profit in name only.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's all about market share and dominance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Looking at APCS A, it's not a great exam or course. At Stuy, I taught
a super-set of the old AB and pretty much ignored the parts I didn't
like (that is, the case study) but many schools can't do that. In my
case, most of the schools my kids went to didn't award credit, even
for a 5. They did sometimes award placement but I've had just as many,
if not more kids gain placement just by showing their work to the CS
department at their chosen school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now they're rolling out APCS Principles. I do get the fact that many
schools don't have people to roll their own courses, but I'm not
overly impressed by much of what's come out. I think what we've
developed is stronger and time proven.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, and moving beyond just CS, the College Board has somehow
bamboozled the public to think AP = Good. Colleges are awarding less
and less credit but everyone's telling the kids to take more and more
AP classes. What's worse, somehow US News and World Report magically
became an authority on school ratings and now the more AP classes your
kids take the better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know of at least one school with a highly lauded principal boast
about all his kids came in behind in math and by their senior year
passed honors calculus. Looking at the data unfortunately showed that
while all his seniors took the class, all failed, scoring below
a 3. It made the school look great but I'd argue that it was child
abuse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The principal of course parlayed that gig to an even higher profile
one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, you could just file the stupid paperwork so that you can run
classes labeled as AP and have kids take the classes but not the exam
but the College Board's working on that - there are rumblings in NY
on using &lt;a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2016/04/13/new-york-considering-using-scores-on-ap-exams-and-sat-subject-tests-in-teacher-evaluations/#.VyyRlN9vGAk"&gt;student AP scores in teacher ratings&lt;/a&gt;. Using student test
results for teacher ratings is already a bad idea - using AP is even
worse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, to really get the cash cow going, AP is entering deals with
agencies and municipalities for large scale testing – in NY students will have to take the
SAT and &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/nyc-will-give-free-sat-testing-to-hs-juniors.html"&gt;take it for free&lt;/a&gt;. Then there's code.org's deal free PD for
school's that have their kids take &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/"&gt;yet another meaningless exam&lt;/a&gt;, the
new PSAT/8-9.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, none of this is free - it's our taxpayer money hard at work
being shuttled right into the college board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What are we getting? Tests that they create and control and are
EXTREMELY secretive about that don't tell us anyhting that we don't
already know about our kids. Oh, and teachers lose instructional time
and have to &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-13-psat.html/#.VyzHNN9vGAk"&gt;proctor&lt;/a&gt; these exams instead of teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Great deal if you can get it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, what's the value of this – more meaningless tests for the
kids. I don't know if there's a record of this anywhere but in the
pre-internet day, I remember watching a news report where a College
Board representative stated that the SAT was a valid predictor of one
thing - how students would do on future SAT exams.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, were left with more money flowing to an outside company with
students taking more meaningless tests.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wish more schools showed the backbone that Fieldston, an elite
private school in NY had when it &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/nyregion/high-school-drops-its-ap-courses-and-colleges-don-t-seem-to-mind.html"&gt;dropped A.P. courses&lt;/a&gt; over 10 years
ago. They still seem to be well regarded as a school and their kids do
just fine in terms of college acceptance.

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;Edit:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the
comments, this post isn't  about what's appropriate for HS CS. It's
more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it
high school, college, code school, or other. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations
of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The two examples are just to illustrate the point. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Original Post:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I enjoy reading blogs. It's one of the ways I keep current. Not only
in terms of what's going on in CS Education, but also trends in CS -
academic or professional as well as on a range of other topics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the blogs I enjoy is authored by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk"&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know
Julia, but we do have some mutual friends. I've enjoyed her &lt;a href="http://jvns.ca"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. She
does a nice job talking about any number of systems related
issue. I've tried to leave comments a few times but for some reason,
my comments always end up deleted or otherwise not showing up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One recent post, one on &lt;a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/29/thread-pools-part-ii-i-love-blocking/"&gt;concurrency&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking. Since the comment
I left there didn't take, I thought I'd write about it here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice post but the thing that caught my eye was when Julia
said that she " didn't know what a semaphore was until I read this
code and I was like OH THIS IS AMAZING AND SO USEFUL AND WOW." I was a
little surprised, semaphores seem to be one of those basic concepts
that you just know but that is, of course incorrect. I first learned
about semaphores in my honors Systems class with my mentor, the late
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dewar"&gt;Robert Dewar&lt;/a&gt;. We started from test and set and worked our way up. I
had two other undergraduate classes that at least mentioned the topic.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then again, I knew that many undergrads would never get a good
treatment of concurrency so I tried to build a bit in to the System
Level Programming  course I designed while at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking - according to her linked in, Julia was a CS
major at McGill - a university that I hold in high regard but either
semaphores were never covered or their treatment didn't make enough of
an impact to be worth remembering. What topics do we cover in our
classes that kids just let fall to the wayside and what topics do we
end up losing as curricula change and we don't have an eye on the big
picture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One big one is memory management. When APCS and college 101 classes
went to Java, memory management went out the window. Not a problem, as
long as memory issues are covered in some other course. Unfortunately
the don't seem to be. You can make a case that kids don't need to
understand memory management or anything about garbage collection but
I'd argue that while one might never have to do their own memory
management a good CS person should have some understanding of what's
going on under the hood or as my friend Gerry says "never use a
technology you couldn't write yourself."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another biggie that I lived through was the IBM PC era. Prior to the
mid to late 80's when the IBM PC ruled the world, kids learned about
CS on timesharing systems. Once the PC took hold, every kid learning
programming or studying CS was working on their own machine. They had
full access to everything and the machine just supported a single
thread. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, it was nice since you could easily play with low
level programming and hardware but on the other hand, a hole
generation didn't learn about the complexities of multiple users and
multiple processes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Early in my career I designed courses and only later did I realize
that you can't just design a course, you have to look at the full arc
of a students education. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think it's interesting to think about what concepts are getting left
on the side of the road and I wonder if the big players driving CS
education spend any time thinking about this bigger picture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The difficulties I've had with the city and DOE are pretty well
documented by now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today I'm going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how
they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city
students. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
CSTUY's not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's not something I'm happy about but part of me knew it might
happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn't have, was the role that
the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line initial reason for us not running SHIP this summer
was my time. Moving over to my new position at Hunter has
been terrific but I haven't had the time needed for adequate
fundraising and outreach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I recently talked a bit about the difficulties we've had with
fundraising as compared to the "chosen programs" in 
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/#.VyKAnh9vH0o"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've also written a bit about related issues in these posts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-03-teachers-suck.html/#.VyKA9R9vH0o"&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-03-teachers-suck.html/#.VyKA9R9vH0o&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.VyKBHB9vH0o"&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.VyKBHB9vH0o&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
In any event, we weren't going to be able to run this summer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I spoke to the team, Sam asked, "if we can keep the budget down
and figure out how to not be dependent on fundraising and outreach, can
we do something?" I told him, I'd love to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He came up with a plan. Instead of a full day program, we'd run half
day - this means fewer staff hours and no lunch. If we could run it at
Stuyvesant, in the computer labs (which already run Linux), we
wouldn't have to worry about equipment. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Under this plan, additional fundraising wasn't needed, in fact, kids
could attend free of charge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of outreach, since we already had sufficient funds, even if
we only got returning shipmates and a few from word of mouth we'd be
ok and if we could cast a wider net, so much the better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and the plan was for me to take the summer off. I'd help with
initial organization but I wouldn't actually work the summer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, to summarize:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free for the kids
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not involved and receive no compensation for the summer (this is
important for later)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My teachers would be paid for teaching in the program and CSTUY
would supply the funds to pay them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We floated the idea to Stuyvesant's principal figuring that since
the teaching staff is from there and some of the kids tat would
benefit are Stuy students it wouldn't be a problem. She said she loved
the idea but had to send it off to the conflict of interests people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You see, it's very important that teachers and former teachers don't
actually benefit from working extra – it's critical that teachers be
kept down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Long story short - the teachers could work the program but aren't
allowed to run it. They can come in and teach but can't talk to the
principal about organizing it. For some reason, running a &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;free&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
program for kids instead of relaxing over the summer means that the
teachers are getting this &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; benefit. Sure they'd be paid for
their time, but that seems fair. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to me, I'm not allowed any dealings with the DOE for a year. Forget
the fact that I wanted to set this up while taking &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; pay so that
the kids wouldn't be left without a program. Nope, that's no good -
can't have us bringing quality CS education to the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I dealt with these folks once before so I wasn't really surprised.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, a friend connected me with people at Amplify
to see about creating their APCS MOOC. We met a couple of times but
then the DOE people said I couldn't work with them even though I was
just going to be working on the MOOC and not dealing directly with the
DOE in any way. I wasn't negotiating contracts, making sales pitches,
or anything. I was just going to work on MOOC content.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It wasn't like a certain NYC School's Chancellor who had just left the DOE and
took the leadership position at Amplify. That wasn't a conflict - I
guess it's just important to keep the teachers in line - the rules
aren't meant for the higher ups.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Funny side note – when I shared the fact that I couldn't work for
Amplify with my friend, his first reaction was "because of the union?"
That seems to be the knee-jerk reaction from people in the business
world. Nope - the union was fine with it - it was the administration /
city. The city has done &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;far&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; more harm to the public schools than
the union ever could. Pretty much all the union does is make sure the
city follows the jointly negotiated contract.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back to the story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, we're not allowed to use school space to bring free CS education
to kids this summer. Plenty of other organizations non-profit and
for-profit alike seem to have no problem bringing their programs into
the schools. I'm sure many are getting money for this, grant based or
otherwise. In all cases, I'd take my team and their program over what
the DOE is actually rolling out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the type of thing makes me want to say to hell with DOE but,
unfortunately, they aren't affected, it's the kids that lose out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cstuy</category><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cstuy-coi/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 21:18:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Awards for Educators</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/awards/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
There are all sorts of awards for teachers. The Presidential awards,
NEA awards, National and State level awards, and more. There are also
awards and honors given in more narrow areas like NCTM for math and
our own ACM.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've haven't won any and never expected to. I've never played well
with the establishment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's ok though. For every honoree that I can point to and say "there's
a master teacher," there are half a dozen who you look at just know
that it was more about politics and connections than about teaching
chops.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Like anyone else, though, I do like a pat on the back and it is nice
to get some confirmation that you're having a positive effect on kids
lives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what are my awards? Well, I received what I consider my highest
honor this past weekend. I was in Hot Springs Arkansas for Jen and
Marcel's wedding. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was a great weekend with old friends and new celerbrating a
wonderful event and I couldn't be happier for the couple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, to be included in your former students life events is as
big as it gets. I can't begin to say how honored I was to be included
in their day. Even more special, that Marcel's brother Barnabas and
his wife Suki are my oldest couple - they started dating back in my
class back in the beginning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not the first time I've been invited to former students
weddings. I've seen around a dozen or so of my students wed. Every
time it's special, just as it's special when a former student decides
to reach out to let me know how they're doing or to reconnect in
general. When they elect to share part of their lives with me, it
tells me that I was at least a little bit of a force for good way back
when.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/awards/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 20:19:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Become a CS Education Thought Leader - No Experience Needed</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few weeks ago, a friend asked if I knew any CS teachers that were
available to work this summer. At the time, I didn't have anyone to
recommend. We were still up in the air on running CSTUY's SHIP summer
immersion program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We ultimately decided not to run SHIP this summer. Mostly due to the
fact that in my new position, I didn't have the time to do the
necessary fund-raising and outreach. We're continuing with our Saturday
program through mid May and plan to bring more opportunities to the
kids of New York City in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's not what I want to write about today. That summer program
looking for a teacher, let's call it program X made me think about
many of the players driving K12 CS education both in NY and beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It turns out, the people that were running program X didn't have a
teacher, didn't have curriculum or program, and in fact didn't have
a plan. What they were able to do, however, was raise money.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a sore spot with me - for CSTUY, we run program to program and
for me, fund-raising is the hardest part. Here we have a program that
has no idea as to what they're going to do or who's going to do it and
they ended up with substantial capital to work this non-existent
program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a sore spot because I've seen it before and seen it over and
over. People with either little or no CS experience, little or no
teaching experience and frequently neither being anointed as thought
leaders in CS Education or at the very least, the people with the "hot
program."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've seen this in companies, non-profits, for-profits, and
government. Some of these groups and programs are now considered
undisputed leaders when, if you dig beneath the hype, they really
don't know what they're doing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, there are some "thought leaders" who have been in the trenches
and know their stuff but they seem few and far between. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know that all of these people running these programs and being given
this platform to influence our young are well meaning and I welcome
everybody to the table but maybe, just maybe they should take a step
back and ask themselves - do they really know what they're doing or
are the just experimenting with other peoples children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 23:36:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>We're Number One!!

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I woke up this morning to an email from my principal "Stuy is #1."
This followed a bunch of Facebook posts by friends and alums of a
similar vein. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was all about a couple of reports, &lt;a href="https://k12.niche.com/rankings/public-high-schools/best-overall/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-public-high-schools-in-america-2015-11"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out
Stuy is ranked #1. Woo Hoo. We're awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, everyone whooping it up now was quick to say "all those
rankings are meaningless" back when US News and World report ranked
Stuy way down on their list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We all know what makes a great school: great students. At least in
terms of perception. Look at most of these lists and they'll be
dominated by high schools that take in high performing students. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Truth be told, in many ways, Stuyvesant isn't a special place, but
more on that down below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of the ratings and rankings they're meaningless but in a way
dangerous. I see it at Stuy. Under the current administration AP is
the word of the day. It's all Advanced Placement all the time.  Why?
That's one of the ways to rise up in the rankings. So are the school
surveys which is why there's been more pressure to get those done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My feelings? AP is all about making money for the College Board. I'm
not a fan of "early college," I'm a fan of enrichment. I've said it
many times - if a course is such that it can be mastered equally well
by a 15 year old in 10th grade as by a 19 or 20 year old in college,
well, it really isn't college level. High achieving, well prepared
high school kids can do college level work in 11th and 12th grades but
probably not in all subject areas. Sure they can memorize, ape, and
mimic, but the depth of knowledge won't be there. Regardless, we
should trust schools and teachers to do it right. Schools can roll out
rigorous courses as good or better than AP. There's no real need for
the College Board seal of approval. Look at &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-mallory/private-schools-ap-tests_b_823616.html"&gt;Fieldston and other
private schools&lt;/a&gt; as examples.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've been teaching our own introductory CS class at Stuy for
years. The entire team knows that it's far superior, at least for our
students, than the new AP CS Principles course yet our principal keeps
pushing the AP course. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've spoken to a number of administrators  from highly regarded schools
over the past couple of years and all are pushing test scores, AP
classes, and anything to get those rankings up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, there's a movement to make Stuy a generic school that happens to
have high performing students which brings me back to are we number
one or indeed are we special?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It certainly has a couple of things going for it. Great kids and a
large size. The large size ensures lots of electives. Stuy is one of
the few schools with a robust set of humanities classes, stem classes,
multiple music groups, and more. That's important. When I sent my kids
to Stuy a big part of the decision was due to the fact that they'd be
surrounded by smart kids whose interests range all over the place. The
kids come from all backgrounds. Also, my kids would be able to explore all
of their current interests and maybe even pick up some new ones.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
But then there's the other side. We have lots of electives and some
are great but then, some are lousy. Just like any other school we have
some amazing teachers and some garbage. For the most part, if you
switched Stuy's faculty and administration with another school, you
might lose a few special electives and gain a few different ones but
by and large people wouldn't notice the difference.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, Stuy and all similar institution should be charged with
something extra. We should be leaders in developing programs and
sharing them with other schools. We should be developing experiences
for our kids that are appropriate to their level of development, not
being happy with high regents scores or the fact that we had a bunch
of Intel semifinalists, many who probably would have accomplished
similar feats regardless of the school they attended.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kowtowing to the rankings kills that possibility. To reach the top of
the charts you have to follow the book. If you want to lead, you have
to write the book.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It would be silly of me to judge my success by how many kids pass the
APCS exam. It's an easy test for them. I've worked hard not to create
classes because I like them, but because they make sense for our
kids. They sequence appropriately, and they give the kids
opportunities and experiences that they wouldn't get had they not
attended Stuy. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, since the late 90's I haven't had the luxury of a
supportive administration that shared my vision. As the school and the
system moves more towards the rankings you're going to see educational
leaders more and more marginalized and finally eliminated. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, is Stuy number one and is it special? As long as it's given the
same type of kids it's had for the past 100 or so years, the kids will
do fine. Is it really special? Well, unless it starts really think
about what the kids need and deserve, maybe not so much.
