&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd7745f1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I'm guessing other high
schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten
year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who've
moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered
crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far
away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm always really flattered and honored when I get a reunion
invite. I've been to my share but I was never the hip popular teacher
that gets invited to these things. On the other hand, I'm sincere,
honest, and loyal so when I do connect with students it's meaningful
and lasting. As one of my students remarked when I was nominated to be
graduation speaker a few years ago and I doubted I would be elected
"hey, you lead the most popular cult in the school" and I guess in
some way the community is a cult, or as I'd rather say, a family. In
any event, whenever I'm invited to a reunion I make my best effort to
attend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I find the role of faculty at reunions as somewhat amusing – we're
something of a prop. The grads are there and should be there to
reconnect with each other. The teachers are and should be secondary.
From my point of view, there are three groups of students. The ones
that are now part of my alumni family - now friends who I'm in touch
with to varying degrees, the ones that never knew me and the ones that
knew me a bit. For the second and third groups, as a faculty member,
I'm there to remind them of the glory days as a representative of the
institution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As with all reunions I had plenty of "I was never in your class
but …" conversations. I also a number of "I majored in
fill-in-the-blank but just found my way back into tech
so….. thanks." I love these conversations - it gets someone
new into "the family." I also had one conversation that was really a
nice ego boost. One of my guys introduced me to his wife. She
immediately exclaimed "it's so great to finally meet you, he talks
about you all the time!" That was kind of weird until she went on
"…every time he talks about Stuy." That made more sense. It's like
all those times when me and my buddy Ben would reminisce about our
Junior High school days and we'd always get back to talking about
&lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html"&gt;Herb&lt;/a&gt;, one of our best and favorite teachers and a major influence on
me while Devorah looked on confused. Eventually she met and got to
know Herb and it all made sense. Another grad added "you think we all
forget about you but you come up more than you know" so I take that as
a shout out to all of the teachers out there who never get to hear
back about how much they are remembered and appreciated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With tools like email and Facebook it's easier to remain connected to
former students but it's always nice to connect in person. For the
StuyCS family, we have our periodic meetups but for the rest, I love
being included in class reunions and hope to be invited to more in
years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org39ef8e1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org39ef8e1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this past year's CSTA conference, a few of us huddled in a corner
voiced a very common lament - "it would be great if more CS teachers
blogged." It really would be. We're still a relatively small
community and while there's some good conversation going on on
mailing lists and on Facebook, those aren't easily discoverable or
accessible and in the case of Facebook, there's a question of
ownership and permanence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been blogging on and off since 2010. Around 300 posts. Not super prolific
but I've been doing it long enough to maybe be able to share a bit of
perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure exactly why I started. In part I was inspired by my wife
who at the time was blogging about her &lt;a href="http://squid-knits.blogspot.com/"&gt;knitting&lt;/a&gt;. I was also inspired
to share my thoughts after meeting some fellow CS teachers from across
the country at a &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-01-02-welcome.html"&gt;CSTA event in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. It was stop and go for a while
and then I took a break. I was re-inspired months later after meeting
a couple of CS teachers at another CSTA event - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ben%20chun&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;Ben Chun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/purplespatula"&gt;Helene
Martin.&lt;/a&gt; Both terrific high school CS teachers at the time who are
unfortunately no longer in the classroom (unfortunate for the kids, I
wish Ben and Helene all happiness and success in all their
endeavors). We all agreed to try to write more and that got me started
again. I've been posting around 50 times a year since.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Looking back to when I used blogger, I had 30 - 50 hits on some early
posts and that was mostly just me hitting the site. It didn't matter.
Writing has let me work through my thoughts. It also creates a record of
my thoughts and on how my thinking evolves over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over time, people have told me that they've found some of the things
I've written useful or helpful and I'd argue that when people disagree
with something I write, even if they don't comment and I've all I've
evoked is a reaction of "Z's full of crap," it's gotten them to
re-evaluate their own thoughts on whatever the subject and if it's
confirmation of their original beliefs, that's OK.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The important thing is that by blogging I'm getting my thoughts down
"on paper" and sharing them for the world to take or leave as they
please and the more of us who do this, the more we expand the sum
knowledge of CS teaches. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a dispersed community of CS teachers across the country, we need
more people blogging on public platforms not in silos like Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've heard reasons why teachers don't blog:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'm new and have nothing to write about&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sure you do – write a paragraph about your plans for the days lesson
or how it went. Vent your frustrations (but be careful not to get
yourself in trouble). Rave about some students work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don't have time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, this is a tough one. If you have to do PD time, maybe your
supervisor will let you use it for blogging. To be honest, when I'm
writing regularly it doesn't take that long. When I haven't written in
a while it takes longer. In any event. It's important and posts don't
have to be long
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'm not a great writer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This blog is proof that you don't have to be. I'm stilted and ramble
and certainly no Shakespeare. I am the weakest writer in my household
and it's not even close. Even so, we all have something to share.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don't know how&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about proposing a session at next years CSTA conference
where I'd work the group through creating a github pages based
blog. In the meantime, there are a lot of easy ways to start out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogger.com"&gt;http://blogger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://wordpress.com"&gt;http://wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and for those who want total control
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, there's my plea. If you're a CS teacher and you're reading this
please consider blogging. I assure you, we will all appreciate it and
benefit from it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org830d1dc"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org830d1dc"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educators StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; is now in public beta. For those of you
who are not in tech, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange"&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; is a network of question answering
sites. &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most famous - many peoples go to
site for computer science and programming questions and answers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During this period of public beta the site will be working on defining
itself and also on developing a critical mass of users. I hope the
site succeeds and I encourage everyone to &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;, ask questions,
answer some and let's all see where this goes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An interesting difference between StackExchanges and most other
communities is that it's a question answering site not a discussion
board or shared resource collection. This works well for programming
questions where you can share a code snippet, algorithm, or derivation
which can be shown to be correct. We'll see how it works for something
more nebulous like education. The voting system should help but the CS
education community is already awash with anointed thought leaders
with little or no teaching or CS experience. It will also be
interesting to see how things develop given that, by and large, K12
educators know a whole lot more about teaching than those in higher ed
while the on the flip side, the professors are generally much
more knowledgeable about the subject matter and then you have the
education researcher which is another beast altogether. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part of me thinks that discussion could be more valuable than answers
and in fact, I'm finding the comments which are more discussion like
to be more interesting, but that's just me. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A side thing I noticed was that the moderators have taken to asking
contributors not to link to other sites but to either write self
contained answers. I understand this desire to have everything under
your roof but it strikes me as wanting to use their silo instead of
someone else's silo. This happened to me on an answer because I had
already written a series of blog posts on the subject. Admittedly, I
just put up four links and could have (and will) provide more context
but I also had no desire to rewrite my content just to share info that
was already out there. Likewise there was a question that was posed on
A* which led to &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/a-star-is-born/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to share my thoughts with "my"
community as well as on the stackexchange and didn't want to have to
do the same thing twice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the moderators claims is that a link might not be
permanent. This is true. My blog might not be around in 5 years but
then the CS Educators StackExchange might not as well. I hope both are
around and thriving but time will tell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This also got me thinking about the  mish mash of
CS Educator communities floating around. I'm familiar with and a
member of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few Facebook groups (CS Education, CS Education Discussion, AP
Comp Sci, APCSP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CS Education subreddit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of mailing lists (the College Board AP Community, SIGCSE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few blogs are kind of communities in that there's a core group of
readers but discussion is pretty sparse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Are there others I'm not aware of?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This has led to a lot of duplication and some fragmentation and there
is a concern about silos. The Facebook groups are very much a silo and
to a certain extent so are the mailing lists. I guess the SIGCSE list
is more community run than the College Board one, but still. Blogs are
our own personal islands so while I wish more people would both blog
and comment about CS Ed they're not necessarily open and permanent
either. At least with some blogs and with the subreddit and
stackexchange we can, if we want, download all of the data if we want
and preserve it for posterity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if there's a solution - maybe we should set up a &lt;a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse"&gt;discourse&lt;/a&gt;
instance - something really open and accessible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any event, please do check out the &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educators StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; and
let's all help it become the best question answering resource it can
be for our community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend was &lt;a href="http://catskillsconf.com"&gt;Catskills Conf&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite events of the
year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you know my wife, you know she's &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; knitting. Ok, not true,
she's always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form
of fiber craft.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can't complain. That's how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy
and Yoda sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks. It also
keeps her an my entire family in warm amazingly beautiful knit wear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While at the conference, Devorah was her usual self - knitting during
the talks. That doesn't mean she wasn't paying attention, it's just
what she does. We also noted a few other attendees knitting throughout
the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, this year, Devorah had an idea – let's focus those idle hands to
do some good. She asked the conference organizers to send out an email
to attendees - knit squares during the conference and Devorah will put
them together at the end and we'll donate the blanket we make to
children in need through &lt;a href="https://projectlinus.org/"&gt;Project Linus&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The organizers were supportive, if not somewhat skeptical. That was
ok - we also had no idea if this would be a win or a flop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Conference came and Devorah announced the project. She brought yarn,
needles, crochet hooks and instructions and also offered to teach
knitting during the breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It started slowly, but as the conference progressed, people started
knitting both during the talks and during the breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; leading knitting for children in need at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hn0rx633e1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hn0rx633e1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/789839861813575680"&gt;October 22, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Experienced knitters cranked out squares and newbies learned.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/knitting-tech-conference/learning.jpg" alt="learning.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jcn"&gt;@jcn&lt;/a&gt; knitting for charity with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash"&gt;#catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rvkSnMYDCp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rvkSnMYDCp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790164027494326272"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the conference, we collected the partials. Devorah's
going to finish the blanket up this week and then it gets donated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;6 X 5 and growing! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/epC9b3ap0t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epC9b3ap0t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devorah Zamansky (@DevorahZamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky/status/790697247965151232"&gt;October 24, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how much of a win was this? We got a blanket to donate to charity
and a couple of new knitters. We also heard and overheard some
interesting comments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One speaker commented that it as much better to see members of the
audience knitting for good rather than checking their cell phones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also overheard some attendees talking about how the knitting
project left them feeling more connected to the conference since they
were able to contribute something.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sounds like a pretty big win to me. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So much so that Devorah's thinking about taking the show on the road -
maybe other conferences would like their idle hands doing some good
while listening to talks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Waking up to a beautiful brisk morning at the Ashokan Center in the Hudson Valley.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year, Devorah and I attended the first &lt;a href="http://catskillsconf.com"&gt;Catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;, a tech
conference in Olivebridge, NY. It was an amazing and unique
experience. I can only describe it as Tech Conference meets Summer
camp. Where else can you hear talks by people like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dens?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Dennis Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and
an alos hear the music of &lt;a href="http://www.mikeandruthy.com/"&gt;Mike and ruthy&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year, I gave another educaiton rant and to add to the fun,
Devorah's been leading a knitting for Charity project and teaching
attendees to knit:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Progress on the charity knitting project led by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash"&gt;#catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yoal7r48wO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yoal7r48wO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790155915307737088"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and we brought up my Hunter College students to join in the fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In spite of the fact that we were out late at the bonfiere:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ending a great day by relaxing next to the fire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LzKbftZamz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LzKbftZamz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christopher Short (@Shortoutloud) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shortoutloud/status/790020785943539712"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and then were kept up by the students bonding and chatting in the
bunkhouse, Devorah and I are first up, bright and early.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'll write up more about this amazing event some time over the
week. Right now, I think I'll just go out and enjoy a cup of coffee
and the clean brisk Hudson Valley air.

I only learned about NYCIST last spring. They're the "New York
Consortium for Independent School Technologists." They had something
of an open house that I attended. I heard about them from friend
and fellow CS educator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ed_saber"&gt;Saber Khan&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last Thursday I spent an afternoon and evening with NYCIST members for
a discussion of the state of K12 Computer Science Education in the
City.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most of my work has been with public schools and most of the teachers
I know, public school teachers so it was great to make new friends in
the Independent school community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One thing I realized during the evening was that NYCIST has a real
opportunity to do something special. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, the public schools are leading the way in computer
science education as a result of this administrations CS4All
initiative but at the same time, public schools face some real
challenges. While some "early adopters" have developed their own take
on computer science education, by and large, CS4All is being defined
and driven by few for all and, at least right now, the model seems to
be the "a little PD and you're a CS teacher" model.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, standardized testing and teacher evaluations are
pressuring schools, particularly schools of our most vulnerable
students to push resources towards test prep in tested subjects rather
than real education, including CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this particular instance, NYCIST and independent schools can be
what charter schools were supposed to be before they were corrupted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Laboratories of innovation. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NYCIST has already gathered together interested parties and the
independent schools aren't burdened by the weight of politically
driven testing and teacher evaluation. At the same time, small class
sizes and flexible models allow for innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If they wanted to, they could probably create curricular and
instructional frameworks for CS education and. dare I say it, share it
back to the public schools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know I'm ignoring independent school politics and other issues that
would prevent this from happening, but I just feel that if there's a
desire to do so from a group like NYCIST, it could happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm looking forward to continuing to work with my new friends and if
any of you are interested in finding out more about NYCIST, just tweet
to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ed_saber"&gt;Saber&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if my idea here will take root but if it does, I'd love
to work with NYCIST to make something happen.

I've been meaning to comment on these tweets for a while:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I went to high school with some scary smart people. Never made math team. Didn't get into honors math. Thought I wasn't good at it.&lt;/p&gt;— Stanislav Nikolov (@snikolov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snikolov/status/748660381392871424"&gt;June 30, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky"&gt;@zamansky&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that's the thing though you can get such an inferiority complex by always comparing yourself to others &lt;a href="https://t.co/LvaMjp1WVf"&gt;https://t.co/LvaMjp1WVf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stanislav Nikolov (@snikolov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snikolov/status/748918417667727360"&gt;July 1, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stan, of course, is one of the most talented people I know. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It reminded me of a conversation I had with my colleague and friend
Jim last year. I had just recieved an email from a former student
turned friend. We were trying to find some time to catch up.  I told
Jim I had just heard from this young lady and Jim replied "I remember
her, she's awesome. Really smart." I mention this because the
individual we were talking about, while to us, extremely talented in
addition to being just a terrific person spent much of her career
living in self doubt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Meantime, I was having a conversation with another friend and the
topic turned to impostor syndrome and the desire to make it a thing of
the past.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Problem is, I don't know if that will ever be the case. I'm
approaching 50 and have a career of good work behind me but I still
find myself questioning my credentials, work, and ability. Then I realized I wasn't alone
when I read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobertTalbert"&gt;Robert Talbert's&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href="http://rtalbert.org/blog/2016/tenure-second-time"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about his going through
the tenure process for a second time and "learning through this process
that I have not outrun impostor syndrome and probably never will."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stan's tweets tell part of the story. When we surround ourselves with
smart, accomplished people, we sometimes feel we don't measure
up. I've found that for the most part, the extremely accomplished
people I've worked with are very unassuming and low key. They seem to
operate assuming that  everyone else is at least as capable and quick as
they. I recall &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html"&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; talking about this in an essay but
I don't remember which one. The problem is, if you don't understand
their sincerity, you end up feeling even more inadequate. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It gets worse when we start comparing ourselves to some unreal
composite. I remember feeling pretty stupid back when I was younger
comparing myself with others. The problem was that I clearly didn't
measure up to the best math kid, or the best computer kid, the best
fencer, the best violinist, etc. Now, the best math kid might have
been a lousy athlete and the best fencer, a so so mathematician, but
to me, I was comparing myself with this composite super human. No
wonder I never measured up. Eventually, though, I realized three
things. First, there's always someone better at something and always
someone worse. Second, that's not the true value of ones worth as a
person, and three, I bring some good stuff to the table and I should
be (and am) content with that
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I still struggle with impostor syndrome but at the end of the day,
it just serves as a reminder to look back on what I've done and what
I've learned in the process.  I start out in question but in the end,
leave confident. Maybe the trick isn't to eliminate impostor syndrome
but rather to understand and contain it. We don't want to live in fear
and anxiety but both are useful emotions when we control them and not
the reverse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's probably good when we question ourselves and re-evaluate our
positions - we just have to make sure as we're bringing new people
into the tech fold that we foster acceptance and confidence  and when
impostor syndrome sets in that it can be channeled into a positive
and not scare people away.

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/facebook.jpg" alt="facebook.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If I look at my leaving Stuyvesant and the NYC Department of
Education to join Hunter College as the end of Act I of my teaching
career, then our family's West Coast swing was a nice way to pull
down the curtain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The impetus for the trip was visiting Batya - she's interning at
Facebook this summer and having an absolute blast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The plan was to spend a few days in San Francisco, then a little south
to Mountain View, where Batya was staying, and then fly up to Seattle
for a couple of days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, while out there, why not see if some of the StuyCS family
wanted to get together.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I knew I had a lot of former students out on the West Coast but still, I was
overwhelmed and humbled by the number of people who wanted to spend
time and catch up. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We kicked things off at Bloomberg Beta thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat"&gt;Roy Bahat.&lt;/a&gt; Roy was
never actually my student but we've gotten to know each other over the
years and I value him as a friend and advisor. Roy provided the food
and the space and about 60 former students + a few old timers showed.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/bloomberg.jpg" alt="bloomberg.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of days later, we had a lunch meetup for the Googlers:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/google.jpg" alt="google.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and a happy hour at Facebook (sorry, no picture). Then in Seattle, a
nice dinner to close things out.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/seattle.jpg" alt="seattle.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Between these events there were some lunches, a barbecue at Batya's
place  and even a drive by visit with a former student at
Microsoft. Overall, it was easily over 100 students over the course of
the week or so we were out there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've often said that one of the things I'm proudest of is helping to
build the StuyCS family. A community of people spanning decades. Over
the week, we had events mixing students from the mid 90's to
youngsters currently in college and on their internships.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seeing all these people meeting and supporting each other gave me a
"proud pappa" type feeling even though I didn't do any more than set
the stage for them getting together.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the week, the conversations were also great - not the straight
tech ones, but the ones that really made me proud of the crew. From
Seth talking about how to better get good CS Ed to more kids, to PJ
discussing why he feels it's so important to be an active mentor to
his young programmers and how to get them to be real thinkers, to
Mike, Sam, Kathy, and Leo discussing the disconnect between
privileged families and those struggling to get by. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What more could a teacher want than their former students being both
happy in their lives and careers as well as good people seeking to
make the world better for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The only thing that made me sad about the trip is that with all the
big events, I really didn't get a chance to spend the time I wanted
with everyone. I hope to do better next time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I've now been at Hunter for one semester and things will really
ramp up in the Fall. I'm still a proud part of our StuyCS family and if
being a part of pulling it together is the legacy I left, I can live
with that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The trip was a nice symbolic way to lower the curtain on act 1. I'm
counting on the StuyCS family and all the other players to help so
that we can make sure act 2 is a success and we can build something
similar for more young people throughout the city and perhaps the country. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>community</category><category>teaching</category><category>tech</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/end-to-act-1/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 17:18:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Discussion Silos</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-03-discussion-silos.html/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In response to the past couple of days where my friends and fellow CS
Ed advocates Alfred Thompson, Rob Underwood, and I had a nice little
discussion via our blogs, Alfred wrote &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/01/when-blogging-works-for-educators.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's great when a number of voices in the community have an open
discussion but one of the things I found myself lamenting was the fact
that a lot of the discussion isn't truly accessible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why not? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The silo known as Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have no problem with Facebook - I like it and use it daily - it's a great way to
keep in touch with former students turned friends. The problem is that
much like Las Vegas, discussions that happen on Facebook stay on
Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I've seen a number of blog posts, some mine, some Alfred's,
some others where the post garnered nary a comment. Head over to
Facebook  and if you're friends with the right people, you might find
a lively, informative discussion. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In one case in particular, one post had independent, overlapping
discussions in at least three Facebook threads.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How much richer would the discussion have been  in a public forum
plus it would be left open for people to discover in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I use &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;. I like it since I can also follow people on
it and I can just embed the code in any page but others like what
Wordpress or Blogger uses for comment threads. In any event, it keeps
the conversation open.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is this really a problem? Maybe not but I do wish people would look
beyond Facebook for discussions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's something I've been trying to get my students to do for
years. I've used a number of tools for class communication:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mail lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piazza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;custom forum software like vanilla&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and haven't found anything that really does the job quite right. I'm
still looking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The kids use these but invariably end up also setting up a Facebook
group for my class and their other classes. I encourage this - they
certainly should have a forum that I can't see. How else can they plan
that surprise party for me :-). In all seriousness though, ideally
they should have a forum free of teachers but they should use the one
with the teacher as much as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The real problem with the kids setting up Facebook groups every year
is that there's no institutional memory. I see the kids, year after
year, have to clear the same hurdles. If they started thinking outside
of the silo of their Facebook communities and just had an ongoing
community for each class - one that passed on from year to year, it
would be of tremendous value for them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I'd like to encourage everyone out there to get our discussions
out into public forums. It would be terrific if more of us would blog
or blog more often and also to take the time to add to the dialog in a
public place.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>community</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-03-discussion-silos.html/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Halloween 2015 - the video</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-01-halloween-video-2015.html/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it
turns out to be a really good idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groo_the_Wanderer"&gt;Groo
the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school
before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few
teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn't
know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over each of the next 20 Halloweens, I did something
different. Sometimes solo, sometimes as a pair and more recently as
part of a team.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What started as a lark has now become something of an obligation but
it's still fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, with no further ado, let's go to the video tape:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81qHI-iNkXg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And of course, the full playlist:
&lt;/p&gt;
