Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I'm guessing other high
schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten
year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who've
moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered
crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far
away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm always really flattered and honored when I get a reunion
invite. I've been to my share but I was never the hip popular teacher
that gets invited to these things. On the other hand, I'm sincere,
honest, and loyal so when I do connect with students it's meaningful
and lasting. As one of my students remarked when I was nominated to be
graduation speaker a few years ago and I doubted I would be elected
"hey, you lead the most popular cult in the school" and I guess in
some way the community is a cult - family I like to say.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also find the role of faculty at reunions as somewhat amusing –
we're something of a prop. The grads are there and should be there to
reconnect with each other. From my point of view, there are three
groups of students. The ones that are now part of my alumni family -
now friends who I'm in touch with to varying degrees, the ones that
never knew me and the ones that knew me a bit. For the second and
third groups, as a faculty member, I'm there to remind them of the
glory days as a representative of the institution. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, as with all reunions I had plenty of "I was never in your
class…" conversations but also a number of "I majored in &lt;span class="underline"&gt;&lt;span class="underline"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but
just found my way back into tech so….. thanks."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
