&lt;p&gt;
The difficulties I've had with the city and DOE are pretty well
documented by now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today I'm going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how
they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city
students. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
CSTUY's not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's not something I'm happy about but part of me knew it might
happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn't have, was the role that
the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line initial reason for us not running SHIP this summer
was my time. Moving over to my new position at Hunter has
been terrific but I haven't had the time needed for adequate
fundraising and outreach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I recently talked a bit about the difficulties we've had with
fundraising as compared to the "chosen programs" in 
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/#.VyKAnh9vH0o"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've also written a bit about related issues in these posts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-03-teachers-suck.html/#.VyKA9R9vH0o"&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-03-teachers-suck.html/#.VyKA9R9vH0o&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/#.VyKA-x9vH0o"&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/#.VyKA-x9vH0o&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.VyKBHB9vH0o"&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.VyKBHB9vH0o&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
In any event, we weren't going to be able to run this summer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I spoke to the team, Sam asked, "if we can keep the budget down
and figure out how to not be dependent on fundraising and outreach, can
we do something?" I told him, I'd love to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He came up with a plan. Instead of a full day program, we'd run half
day - this means fewer staff hours and no lunch. If we could run it at
Stuyvesant, in the computer labs (which already run Linux), we
wouldn't have to worry about equipment. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Under this plan, additional fundraising wasn't needed, in fact, kids
could attend free of charge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of outreach, since we already had sufficient funds, even if
we only got returning shipmates and a few from word of mouth we'd be
ok and if we could cast a wider net, so much the better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and the plan was for me to take the summer off. I'd help with
initial organization but I wouldn't actually work the summer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, to summarize:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free for the kids
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not involved and receive no compensation for the summer (this is
important for later)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My teachers would be paid for teaching in the program and CSTUY
would supply the funds to pay them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We floated the idea to Stuyvesant's principal figuring that since
the teaching staff is from there and some of the kids tat would
benefit are Stuy students it wouldn't be a problem. She said she loved
the idea but had to send it off to the conflict of interests people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You see, it's very important that teachers and former teachers don't
actually benefit from working extra – it's critical that teachers be
kept down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Long story short - the teachers could work the program but aren't
allowed to run it. They can come in and teach but can't talk to the
principal about organizing it. For some reason, running a &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;free&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
program for kids instead of relaxing over the summer means that the
teachers are getting this &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; benefit. Sure they'd be paid for
their time, but that seems fair. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to me, I'm not allowed any dealings with the DOE for a year. Forget
the fact that I wanted to set this up while taking &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; pay so that
the kids wouldn't be left without a program. Nope, that's no good -
can't have us bringing quality CS education to the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I dealt with these folks once before so I wasn't really surprised.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, a friend connected me with people at Amplify
to see about creating their APCS MOOC. We met a couple of times but
then the DOE people said I couldn't work with them even though I was
just going to be working on the MOOC and not dealing directly with the
DOE in any way. I wasn't negotiating contracts, making sales pitches,
or anything. I was just going to work on MOOC content.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It wasn't like a certain NYC School's Chancellor who had just left the DOE and
took the leadership position at Amplify. That wasn't a conflict - I
guess it's just important to keep the teachers in line - the rules
aren't meant for the higher ups.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Funny side note – when I shared the fact that I couldn't work for
Amplify with my friend, his first reaction was "because of the union?"
That seems to be the knee-jerk reaction from people in the business
world. Nope - the union was fine with it - it was the administration /
city. The city has done &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;far&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; more harm to the public schools than
the union ever could. Pretty much all the union does is make sure the
city follows the jointly negotiated contract.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back to the story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, we're not allowed to use school space to bring free CS education
to kids this summer. Plenty of other organizations non-profit and
for-profit alike seem to have no problem bringing their programs into
the schools. I'm sure many are getting money for this, grant based or
otherwise. In all cases, I'd take my team and their program over what
the DOE is actually rolling out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the type of thing makes me want to say to hell with DOE but,
unfortunately, they aren't affected, it's the kids that lose out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last March, we (CSTUY) hosted our first hackathon - def hacks():
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was a tremendous success. Fifty students of all experience levels,
a bunch of great mentors and judges - added all together and it was a
terrific day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wrote about it &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/29/defhacks.html#.VkFAN5_0-Ak"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're doing it again. We love last years hosts &lt;a href="http://sumall.com/"&gt;SumAll&lt;/a&gt; and are grateful
that they continue to host our Saturday &lt;a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions"&gt;Hacking Sessions&lt;/a&gt; but we are
also grateful to Facebook NY for allowing us to use their larger space for
this edition of def hacks(). Larger space = more hackers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, if you're a high school student who wants to spend a fun day
building something cool or if you know one, more information and
registration can be found here:

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we kicked off Hacking Sessions 2015. Saturday morning with sixty kids in a room
brainstorming ideas.  Soon they'll settle on teams and projects and
we'll be off for a semester of exploring CS and tech.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next couple of weeks will be a little chaotic with groups
shifting, mentors figuring out which groups to work with and us, the
instructors launching each team on its way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is our third year running Hacking Sessions. We're setting things
up to have student teams exploring a project, technology, or
tool. Each team will have more experienced students mentoring them. In
some cases the mentors will also be new to the topic. Supporting both
the hackers and mentors are our instructors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm pretty happy with our model but it took us a couple of iterations
to get here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our first go round was Fall 2013. We had just started CSTUY and wanted
to get something started prior to launching a summer program. &lt;i&gt;SumAll&lt;/i&gt;
provided us with space and we were able to attract a small cadre of
kids. We had a few of our older students as teaching assistants and
ran the program with a mix of instruction and projects. Over the year
we saw that a Saturday program presents a number of challenges:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students have other obligations on Saturdays such as athletic
teams. This can lead to inconsistent attendance.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SATs also kill attendance
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't count on the participants to work between the sessions.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lateness can be an issue early on a Saturday morning.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a week makes building a community a challenge.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kids have enough classroom learning during the week. Saturday should
be a change of pace.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We learned a lot that year and ran V2.0 the following fall. Second
time around we had the advantage of bringing in kids from our summer
program to seed the culture. We also knew we wanted to move to more of
a project / mentor based model but due to space restrictions couldn't
really get to where we wanted to be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That changed halfway through when SumAll moved to larger offices. By
the end of the year, I think we worked out most of the kinks. We
figured out how to get the kids into teams and pointing in the right
direction as well as  how to find the right mentors and provide them
with support. The only thing we weren't happy with was that the mentors
didn't have enough time to work on their own projects. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now we're in V3.0. Thanks to our &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/262929085/saturday-hacking-sessions"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;, we're fully funded and
somehow word seems to have gotten out. Numbers are way up and I think
we've finally gotten the model down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As with anything new, it takes time and revisions to get things right
but as long as one leaves the kids with a net positive and as long as
one can look at oneself with a critical eye, you eventually get there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward to a great year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
As many of you know, I'm part of the team behind &lt;a href="http://cstuy.org/about"&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit
dedicated to bringing the best CS education to kids who wouldn't
otherwise have the opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the past two summers we've hosted our highly succesful immersion
program SHIP. We were also able to run a small Saturday program thanks
to the generosity of &lt;a href="http://sumall.com"&gt;SumAll&lt;/a&gt; who provided space, and other members of
the StuyCS family who provided laptops and the funds we needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're trying to do it again, this time through a kickstarter. What
would be really awesome is if we could not only fund the Saturday
program but also the summer program so we can focus on getting to the
kids and not on raising money.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, we need you to head over to:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/262929085/saturday-hacking-sessions"&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/262929085/saturday-hacking-sessions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Watch the video, read the project, and kick in for the cause.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just as importantly, spread the word - your friends, co-workers,
managers, funders - anyone who can help.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Wouldn't it be asweome if we could blow the roof off this kickstarter
and be able to focus all year on teaching kids!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thanks.

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today was the last day of SHIP 2015, CSTUY's summer immersion
program. I was blown away by the projects. The shipmates and the
stewards all did tremendous work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All through the reception parents would come up to me and rave about
the job I did with the program. They'd thank me, tell me how exited
their child was every day, how proud they were of what they were
learning and on and on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I of course nodded and told them that "yep, I'm that good."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No. Seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First I thanked them and then told them the secret. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I forget who said this but some coach or manager was one asked "what
makes a great manager?" His answer: "Great players."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I explained to the parents that I've been fortunate enough to be
surround by amazing teachers and that's what makes our program
special. We've got the best program because we've got the best
teachers. The best thing I can do is point them in the direction of
the kids and get out of the way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this post is an open thank you and congratulations to JonAlf, Sam,
Topher, and Yulia on yet another job well done. Four amazing CS
teachers. There's been a lot of discussion in the online CS communities
about CS teachers being isolated and not having resources but I am
fortunate in being surrounded by you four. I can't think of another
team that I'd rather "go to war" with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, I don't want to leave out the other amazing players that made
SHIP a success. Chris, Marlena, Stanley, and Valeriy. Chris, Marlena,
and Stanley - you allowed us to give the individual attention we
needed for this program and students and parents sang your praises and
Valeriy, you were able to show the stewards stuff far beyond what I
could have.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And to all our Stewards - your impact on the shipmates was also so
critical to the programs success and that doesn't even mention your
projects which blew me away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So to everyone, congratulations, job well done.

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
This past Saturday, 50 high school students, 10 high school mentors, and 10
more post high school mentors headed down to &lt;i&gt;SumAll&lt;/i&gt; to participate in
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;def hacks(2015):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;CSTUY&lt;/i&gt;'s first hackathon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fifty participants, came from all over the city, Long Island, and
New Jersey. They ranged from having never programmed to three or four
years experience. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Projects ranged from web sites to full stack applications. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After workshops run by CSTUY teachers and mentors and also by
&lt;a href="http://codesters.com"&gt;Codesters.com&lt;/a&gt; the hackers spread out all over SumAll's offices, working in small
groups with the support of our amazing mentors.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Four nourishment, we had sandwiches from &lt;a href="http://amishintribeca.com/"&gt;Amish Market&lt;/a&gt;, pizza from
Wanted Pizza, snacks and those amazing doughnuts from &lt;a href="http://doughbrooklyn.com"&gt;Dough Flatiron&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;
&lt;figure style="float:left;padding:20px"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, the hackers demoed and the judges judged
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;
&lt;figure style="float:left;padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img height="300px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/dh2015/dh-winner-demo.jpg"&gt;

 &lt;img height="300px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/dh2015/dh-judging.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the end everyone made something terrific and walked away having
built new skills, met new people, and gotten a little swag.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/dh2015/dh-certificate.jpg" alt="dh-certificate.jpg" width="300px" align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The judges singled out two groups for special
recognition. One was a team of four experienced programmers who put
together a full stack app to help schedule parent/teacher meetings.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/dh2015/dh-winner-group.jpg" alt="dh-winner-group.jpg" width="300px" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other was a solo project from a young man who had never programmed
prior to the event. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That one really blew me away. We were able to give these groups
Raspberry Pis thanks to a last minute donation from &lt;a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/"&gt;Fullstack Academy&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
None of this would have been possible without the help of:

I wanted to do a couple more posts on the &lt;a href="http://cstuy.org"&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt; summer program SHIP,
particularly about getting funding and reflections but I think I'll
just wrap things up with the school year starting. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Overall it was an amazing success and I'm amazingly proud of the
entire team (in no particular order):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Devorah, JonAlf, Sam, Yulia, Topher, Ethan, 
Leslie, Brian, Andreas, Natan, Miranda, Nadia, Fawn, Lise, Jessica,
Angela, Benedict, Elise, Fish, and Derek.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and also proud of all the shipmates. Looking at where they started and
where they ended up – they were really terrific.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The only downside is knowing what we can accomplish when we have the
freedom, it reminds me about how badly we're
handcuffed by our school and the department of education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are links to all the posts in case anyone's interested:

&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the most important, possibly the most important part of SHIP's
success was the crew and that's what sets us apart.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've seen CS Ed organizations run by business people, lawyers,
investors and more.The people developing curriculum are EdTech people,
entrepreneurs and anything but seasoned educators. I've seen programs
developed, curriculum created and then the search for teachers
commence. Ofttimes real educators aren't involved at all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're teachers all the way down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've said it before and I'll say it again - it's not about the
curriculum, it's about the teachers. Take, for example, math. Math curricula
have been well defined for years but we still have major problems with
math education. The bottom line is that it's the teacher in the room
that can bring a topic to life or kill it. A great teacher can make
a lousy curriculum decent. A great curriculum won't do anything for a
lousy teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's where we will succeed - we've got the best teachers and
that's our crew.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, onto the crew.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm fortunate enough to have worked with some terrific teachers. If
they'd allow it, I'd like to think of three of them as my
proteges. Sam and JonAlf were actually students of mine when they were
at Stuy but I include Topher in the mix. Our fourth teacher, Yulia,
was JonAlf's student teacher this past year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coaching trees have become popular in recent history. It's kind of cool
that we have one for CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img height="400px" width="600px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/ship-crew/tree1.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Coaching tree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it extends up as well, although my mentors, excepting Robert, didn't teach
CS. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img height="400px" width="600px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/ship-crew/tree2.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Extended coaching tree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And of course the rest of the team have other influences as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So let's talk about the crew.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-1" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="sec-4-0-1"&gt;JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like to describe JonAlf as a younger, hipper version of me. Of
course, I set the hip bar pretty low. I tell my kids that I used to be
the young teacher but I was never the hip teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf and I are probably the most similar in style. Of course, this
means that if you put us in a room together, all productivity
ceases. We've come up with such great ideas as our mascot, Clyde
"Thluffy" Sinclair," the Stuy CS semi-formal and more (or is that
less).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He's been my partner in crime since he came on board. Back in the day
I was the only teacher of our post AP classes and I was delighted to
offload some of that burden to JonAlf.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-2" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="sec-4-0-2"&gt;Topher Brown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf was the hip one (with the bar, admittedly set pretty low) until
Topher came aboard. Topher didn't go to Stuy so he can never be a made
man, but he's pretty awesome, nonetheless. He came in as a math
teacher who just coincidentally had a bit of a CS background. He fit
into our insanity from day one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-3" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="sec-4-0-3"&gt;Sam Konstantinovich&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sam was also my student. He's the mature one (again, the bar was set
pretty low). I joke that he has the reputation for being the mean one
because his first day at Stuy he said something that scared some of
his students. Definitely more together and organized than the rest of
us I tried to convince him to join our team for three or four years
before he finally came over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just to be sure no one misreads my comments on Sam. I've trusted him
with my son's CS education. I think that should tell you how much I
think of him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-4" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="sec-4-0-4"&gt;Yulia Genkina&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yulia's the new kid on the block. We all went in feeling very positive
about having her on the team. At least until she tried to off all of
us on Pirate Day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;
&lt;figure style="float:left;padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img height="150px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/ship-crew/dw.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Yulia trying to off JonAlf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure style="padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img height="150px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/ship-crew/sam.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;
&lt;figure style="float:left;padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img height="150px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/ship-crew/topher.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Topher&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure style="padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img height="150px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/ship-crew/z.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;and me&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seriously though, she fits right in and is also a real talent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-5"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's the crew. I'm amazingly proud of all of them and one of the
things I was most happy about my role in SHIP was that I was able to
empower them to be themselves and just do their thing. When you have
a great crew that's how you do it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the day we filed the paperwork to create CSTUY, we knew we wanted
to run a summer program. In fact, we started looking for a space
during the 2012/2013 school year. We were hoping to run SHIP for the
first time in the summer of 2013 but we all knew it wasn't really a
realistic goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our original plans required at least one classroom sized space, and up
to three for full days for a month. We figured this would be a hard
sell for a tech company, after all, what company is going to take a
room, let alone three, off line for half the summer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, we turned to institutions of higher learning. I started talking to friends at a CS
program in one of our city's colleges. They loved the idea of hosting
a CSTUY program. Problem was that once the plans went up through the
college channels, the administrative side wasn't as hot to host
us. While the CS people really wanted us, the administrative side was
perfectly willing to give us space as long as we paid an amount that
really was much more than we could afford. To be honest, this really
irritated me. Here we have a supposedly non-profit college that's
supposed to support the community and the public good nickle and
diming another non profit that really is trying to do some good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ended up speaking to a number of educational institutions across
the city and the situation was the same. Sure you can have space. Here
are our rates…..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-5"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, you might wonder, why not just use high school space? Because it
was important to be hosted at what should be the "next level" for the
participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-6"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the mean time, I met &lt;a href="http://www.sjcny.edu/FacultyExperts/124"&gt;Bill McAllister&lt;/a&gt;, CS Professor at St. Joseph's
College on Long Island. He hosts a terrific annual high school
&lt;a href="http://faculty.sjcny.edu/~ProgrammingCompetition/"&gt;programming competition&lt;/a&gt;. Bill referred me to David Seppala-Holtzman
the Math and CS Chair at the Brooklyn Campus. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
David and I clicked and one thing led to another and in the end,
having overlapping visions and goals, St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn
decided to host us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I couldn't ask for a better partner. They provided us with all the
facilities we needed from rooms for the classes, to lounge space, to
access to the cafeteria (and got us a great rate on food to boot).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The whole St. Joseph's family made everything so easy for us. At one
point one of our instructors commented "wow, this is such a friendly
campus."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Without the help and support of St. Joseph's college, SHIP doesn't
happen. It was a great partnership and we're looking forward to
working together on SHIP 2.0 next year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cstuy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-08-08-ship-partners.html/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2014 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Building a SHIP - Outcomes</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-08-05-ship-outcomes.html/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SHIP ended last week. So, how did we do? Time to look at outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Outcomes can be tricky. There are lots of programs out there and they
all claim amazing results. Unfortunately, it seems to me, that
everyone's so concerned with good PR that, well, you know, lies,
damned lies, statistics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First you've got claims like "learn how to make a mobile app in under
n weeks." I always chuckle at this. If it was that easy, why do we
have a tech talent shortage? I'm immediately skeptical of any program
that claims that kids go from nothing to making full featured web
apps or some amazing professional quality game in just a few
weeks. Learning takes time. The only way you get these miracle results
is by using frameworks, simplified tools, or scaffolding of some
kind. True learning, retention, and the ability to transfer knowledge
is minimal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we have assorted stats. Here's one of my favorites.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our students outperform other students who take APCS. We see this from
screened programs. Now, I have no problem with screening – we do this
at CSTUY, just don't imply that you're just taking everyone who
applies. If you have an application or an interview, you're screening
and starting ahead of the game. Since kids have to elect to come to
our programs they certainly have a good deal of interest. So, what
this claim is really saying is that a kid who likes CS enough to spend
their summers and or after school time doing it is likely to do better
than a kid who isn't going to spend this time doing CS. Big surprise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, how do we measure our outcomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-5"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can start with the work the
shipmates did. We use processing and the shipmates learned from the
ground up. That is, they wrote everything from scratch. Some of the
groups taught themselves how to use processing libraries if they
needed facilities like a web API or accessing a camera, but since they
built everything up from simple statements, if they successfully
completed good projects, we could be pretty sure they've moved from
neophytes to programmers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The projects were terrific
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The screen shots are just two samples but all the shipmates put
together great projects and since we used real tools, the shipmates
are well prepared for their next courses be they with us, in school,
or elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Stewards also completed projects. I talked a bit about them in my
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/07/30/ship-demo-day-tomorrow.html#.U-Frpx_GyzU"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-6"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also looked at surveys. We did ask some of the soft questions that
I alluded to above. Are you more likely to explore CS after SHIP?
How has SHIP influenced your opinion of CS and Tech? The answer to
the first was an overwhelming yes and the second was also
overwhelmingly positive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The money questions though, were did they want to come back for a
Saturday program and one next summer. Other than the shipmates that
lived too far away, again, the vast majority want to return.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-7"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Combine the programs they made and the fact that they want to come
back with great unsolicited feedback from parents and the shipmates
themselves and I think we can say that SHIP was a tremendous success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-8"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now we have to figure out how to raise the funds for the Saturday
program and next summer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
