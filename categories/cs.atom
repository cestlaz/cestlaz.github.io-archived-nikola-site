    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over on Facebook, a fellow CS educator &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/disclosing-bugs/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; made a comment on something he
wanted to try with his students this summer: having the students
pre-disclose bugs when they submit their projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The post was asking for any links to "the literature." I can't speak
to that but I I've done something similar to what the post was asking
about so, as per usual, I thought I'd write about it here. It may not
be "research" but I'm more interested in teacher practices than ivory
towers anyway so here goes…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At a very basic level, I ask my students to provide a roadmap to any
project they submit - usually in a readme file. I basically ask:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the project
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's cool and I should make sure to check out
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What doesn't work, where were the sticking points and what's the
status.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I tell my students that when I test the project, I'm not "out to get
them" and by their telling me how to navigate the project, it makes
sure I see things in the best possible light. I also tell them that I
will be more harsh on bugs that they don't tell me about -
particularly bugs that only occur some of the time.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I also encourage (and sometimes require) that students maintain a
changelog in their repo and also sometimes encourage them to have a
todo list and list of bugs and for longer projects, I expect to see
these and the readme updated over the course of the project (which
should always be up to date on &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, Dropbox or wherever the project
is living). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When the students provide a good write up it makes evaluating the
project much easier.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
When students buy in, they're hopefully thinking more deeply about
their projects in terms of design and implementation and also from the
point of view of someone else using their product. When they maintain
the readme and other files over time, it also enables me to better
support them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, does this work? Yes but with some caveats. It works better once
the class and teacher know each other. If the students trust the
teacher they're more likely to be open and honest when they write up
the project. On the other hand, there will always be some students to
"phone it in" and do the bare minimum in terms of writing up their
projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that having the students do this is has a low cost
and is beneficial to both the students and the teacher. When it works,
it's great and when it doesn't, it's still pretty good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="text-footnotes"&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/disclosing-bugs/#fnr.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class="footpara"&gt;
I'm not sharing names from the Facebook post because it was
made in a semi-private forum and I haven't asked permission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Over on the &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educator StachExchange&lt;/a&gt;, which is in private beta for a
few more days, I saw a post asking about how to introduce the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"&gt;A*
search algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I taught A* as part of the APCS class at Stuy so I thought I'd talk
about what I did here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some time around mid year, we get to intermediate recursion. This is
about the time, give or take, when we talk about the nlogn sorts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also build a recursive maze solver. It's a nice algorithm and a
nice little program. It's around 15 lines of code to perform a
recursive depth first search:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/astar/dfs.gif" alt="dfs.gif" align="center" height="200px"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basic algorithm is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* solve the maze from an x,ylocation */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Yay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nf"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;previous&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;mark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nf"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice lesson because in addition to all the recursion stuff, we
also get to talk about state space, state space search, backtracking,
efficiency concerns and much more. After we finish the maze solver, we also talk about
other problems that can be similarly examined using state-space search
like the knights tour and N-queens problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A month or so later, when we're learning about stacks and queues as
data structures, we revisit the maze solver. This time we solve the
problem in a more general way. We talk about using a data structure to
hold the set of nodes that we're aware of and that we want to visit
next. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;goal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adjacent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;isn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;mark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As we write the solution, we see that using a queue for this
data structure yields a breadth first search:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/astar/bfs.gif" alt="bfs.gif" align="center" height="200px"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
while using a stack yields depth first. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this leads to a discussion as to how deciding on which
locations to look at next can greatly influence the steps to the
exit. From here it's easy to see that you can use a heuristic to order
the nodes in our data structure so that we explore "better"
possibilities first. The data structure becomes a priority queue and
we finally get to both "best first" and A* search:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/astar/astar.gif" alt="astar.gif" align="center" height="200px"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice sequence of lessons, albeit lessons spread out over
months. The end result is that the students see both the need and
motivation for something like A* and they see that it's not hard to
implement. One basic routine where you can plug in one of three data
structures - stack, queue, or priority queue to get very different
results.

    <title>A new first language? What's the follow up plan?</title>

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial"&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; wrote about Stanford possibly &lt;a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/04/21/cs-department-updates-introductory-courses-java-is-gone/"&gt;moving away
from Java&lt;/a&gt; as their intro language. This comes on the heels of a
semi-regular thread on one of the lists I'm on asking about what
languages are used at assorted colleges around the country. Invariably
the Pascal -&amp;gt; C++ -&amp;gt; Java progression of APCS turns up in these
threads.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are plenty of arguments to be made both for and against pretty
much any language or platform. There's no single best universal
answer. Each choice giveth and each choice taketh away. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I'm really curious about is who's looking at intro languages in
the context of complete programs or even complete educations that
could span multiple institutions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Early language choices can make a big difference in engaging and
exciting newcomers but there are ramifications later on that few seem
to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Take the APCS change from C++ to Java. It removed memory management
from the first year course. It also simplified issues relating to
pass by value vs pass by reference (or, rather, passing address by
value), bought much more strongly into OOP and moved more towards
using built in implementations of data structures like Lists rather
than rolling your own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Removing memory management from the first year course in and of itself
isn't a problem as long as it's taught and taught effectively
somewhere later on. It could be argued that "memory is already covered
in our required systems course." That could be the case, but there are
many concepts that kids don't get the first time around. Is an
institution that covered memory management in CS1/2 and then came back
to it in a later Systems course giving their students the same
understanding now that they've eliminated the CS1/2 experience? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about OOP buy in. Personally, I've never been a big OOP fan but
that's neither here nor there. What I have found is that depending on
how a student is exposed to programming in CS1/CS2 can have a big
influence on how they approach problems later. Did the move to Java
cause more of our students to try to use shoehorn OOP into a problem
that really shouldn't be approached in an OOP manner?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suspect that the use of built in data structures has had a
negative impact. A few years after the switch to Java, I was talking
to a senior tech worker. He was having a bad day - interviewing
potential internees and full time engineers. My friend was complaining
that the kids couldn't come up with solutions to what he thought were
pretty straightforward questions. He felt that had the kids actually
implemented algorithms like the nlogn sorts rather than just learning
java .sort method and just talking about the algorithm they'd be
better prepared. I've heard this sentiment repeated over and over
throughout the years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that Java is a horrible language or horrible for
teaching - that's another debate. The point is that you can't just
look at the intro class and who it draws in. You have to consider how
it will prepare students for the next level and you have to look at
the big picture – will our students get everything they need by the
time they leave us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many schools have moved to Python. Will that effect students take on
type systems later on? Will the flexibility and constructs like list
comprehensions make it harder to teach recursion since there are
"easier" ways to do it? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
None of these are really problems so long as the CS1/2 (or even CS0)
isn't taught in a vacuum. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I fear, however that too often we're paying attention to the intake of
the pipe and not so much the output.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SIGCSE 2017 - a path to github part 1</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-1/</id>
    <updated>2017-03-16T09:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <published>2017-03-16T09:11:00-04:00</published>

      <name>Mike Zamansky</name>
    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-1/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both at and prior to SIGCSE 2017, I promised to write up the steps I
take to introduce and use revision control systems in my classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This series is not meant to be a git or &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; tutorial. There are
plenty of those already (two of which I've linked to below).  This is
about the process I use with my students to get them up to speed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As with any new tool, there will be some resistance but once git saves
them once, they get religion. There will also be some bumps in the
road but at the end of the day, the students will be using a valuable
and necessary tool. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was also surprised at the ancillary benefits I got as a teacher by
using GitHub in particular. I'll talk about that at the end of the
series.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Here's part one. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm doing this with git and GitHub but there's no reason why other
systems and hosts can't be used. I'd also recommend that any educator
or student sign up for the assorted &lt;a href="https://education.github.com/"&gt;discounts&lt;/a&gt; offered by GitHub.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've followed this basic idea multiple times and done it over the
course of a single semester, a year, and even two years. Regardless of
time frame, the idea is the same. Make each step simple and relevant
and introduce complexity and roadblocks a piece at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Step 1 - code distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, I don't even talk about version control. We start with code
distribution. For years, I've looked for efficient ways of sharing
code with my classes. Both code developed in class and code for
assignments. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've tried things like NFS, Dropbox, online code repositories like the
files section of systems like Moodle or Blackboard.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At Stuy, we've always had efficiency problems with NFS and Dropbox has
multiple problems ranging from students not being able to install the
client on school machines to the problems of the network hit when a
room full of kids are syncing at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Uploading to a CMS system was also problematic - I'm a command line
wonk and hate going through slow web page menus to navigate a
filesystem and upload files. I also had to remember to get the files
off of whatever machine I was working on in class and then transfer
them to the CMS when I had a free moment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enter git. Now, of course, if you're going to use git in the classroom
you have to know it. There are plenty of resources out there. Online
courses, articles, videos, and tutorials. Here are a couple:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://try.github.io/"&gt;https://try.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also want to point out that I just use raw command line git along
with native GitHub. GitHub has rolled out &lt;a href="https://classroom.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt; which adds
a layer of support for educators. I don't use it because, as I said,
I'm an old school command line wonk and also because I figured out a
sequence that worked for me and my students before GitHub Classroom
existed. Were I starting now, I'd take some time to look at their
current offerings before jumping in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-1"&gt;Set up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before starting, make sure you register your ssh keys. &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; help page
has more information. You'll want to register an ssh key from every
machine you use - home, work, laptop. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Now go over to GitHub and make a new repository. I usually name it
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;classcode&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGINNER NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; when creating the repo, make sure to
check the "initialize this repository with a README" box. If you don't
you'll be given a set of instructions on how to set things up once you
click &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create repository&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; but it's easier and easier to follow if
you start with an initialized repo with a README.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I make the repo public – it's code I'm distributing – nothing to
hide here. If you aren't comfortable with that, just make the repo
private. If you've registered as a teacher with GitHub, you can set up
an organization and you'll be able to set up free private repos within
it. The other downside here is that you'll have to individually give
each student access to the repo. That's a mild annoyance but it only
has to be done once.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-2"&gt;Teacher use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, clone out the repo. &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGINNER NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Make sure you check out
the ssh version not the https version. Just make sure that when you
click the &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;clone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button, it says "Clone with SSH." If not, just
click the "Use SSH" link in the same box. Students will clone the
using https.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the teacher point of view, you can just start using the repo. My
work flow is typically:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git pull&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the start of class
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write code throughout class
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git add&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git commit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git push&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the end of class
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use a similar flow when I want to add files in my office or at home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-3"&gt;Student use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the student point of view, assuming a public repo, they just have to clone the repo and
at the beginning of every class or work session, do a &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git
pull&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. That's all there is to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-4"&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's it. The kids are now using GitHub – they're probably looking
at and poking around on the web site as well as pulling files to their
machines. You can also, in class, show things like &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git status&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git log&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;git diff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to set the stage for step 2 of this
process and beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since the students aren't adding, committing or pushing, you probably won't
get any errors. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The only problem that could reasonably occur is if a student places a
file in their local copy of the repo with the same name as something
they haven't pulled yet. This is pretty easy to address and provides a
nice stepping stone lesson to again, set the stage for more complex
operations.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I'm happy with this as a first step towards git using GitHub. It
provides a nice way of sharing class code while gently introducing the
students to the tool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next step  is having the students add files to a repo. That's the
next post in this series.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SIGCSE 2017 - Recap</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a high school teacher, I was never able to attend SIGCSE, the
conference of the ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer Science
Education. Between the number of instructional days I would lose and
the cost, I could never justify going. Instead I looked over the
proceedings and read many of the papers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now that I'm at Hunter, I was finally able to attend. This year in
Seattle, the conference ran from Wednesday through Saturday. I was
part of a panel on "Tools we can't live without." Over the next few
weeks, I hope to blog about a number of things I thought and talked
with people about over the conference including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path I use to teach git and why GitHub a good teaching tool
(my talk).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relationship of different CS Ed stakeholders - teachers,
researchers, organizations, etc.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching at the high school level vs college - perceptions and
reality.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The challenges of tech tool adoption in schools.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's going on in K12 CS Certification.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe some other stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today, some overall thoughts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;The good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As with many conferences, the "hallway track" along with receptions
sponsored by &lt;a href="https://csnyc.org/our-work/cs4all"&gt;the CS4All consurtium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tealsk12.org"&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://code.org"&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt; were terrific. I
was able to finally meet in person many people who I've only known
virtually and got to know many more as well. I left the conference
with a much larger address book and a long list of follow up
items. Being in Seattle, I also enjoyed being able to spend time with
people from &lt;a href="http://tealsk12.org"&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://code.org"&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;, two of the CS Ed groups working hard
to do some real good (yes - I do like and support these guys even
though I call them out on things I disagree with, but that's the
subject of another post). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I attended sessions on CS certification, teacher preparation,
assessments, POGIL based instruction to name a few. They ranged from
valuable to interesting and to be honest, a couple of "what were they
thinking" but the overall experience was very much worth the trip. I
also got to speak to a number of wonderful students at the
poster sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The keynotes are also well worth a read (sorry if you don't have ACM
digital library access). &lt;a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025045&amp;amp;CFID=738971273&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=22106692"&gt;Jeannette Wing&lt;/a&gt; talked about the importance of
probability and statistics in CS Ed, and aspects of  &lt;a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025047&amp;amp;CFID=738971273&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=22106692"&gt;Gail Chapman&lt;/a&gt;'s talk
"Inspire, Innovate, and Improve…" keynote and &lt;a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025046&amp;amp;CFID=738971273&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=22106692"&gt;Mitch Resnick&lt;/a&gt;'s
"Fulfilling Papert's Dream" both spoke to the educator inside me. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;The bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest downside to me was that I found very little value added in
a number of the paper sessions over just reading the papers. Part of
this is probably because of my own over-inflated expectations given the
number of years I've waited to attend. Part of it though, was the fact
that sessions were so tightly packed that I didn't have time to follow
up with presenters before having to run to the next
thing. Unfortunately, in some
cases, it was because the presenter merely
"read" the paper much as a professor sometimes just reads the slides
or the book to his class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;Other thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One paper presentation I very much liked was &lt;a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3017701&amp;amp;CFID=738971273&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=22106692"&gt;Exam Wrappers: Not a
Silver Bullet&lt;/a&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://michellecraig.github.io/"&gt;Michelle Craig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~bdstephe/"&gt;Ben Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;. I
actually came in late since I was hustling over from the Code.org
lunch. The result was that I didn't actually know what "Exam Wrappers"
were until well after the talk when I ran into &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jkhuggins"&gt;Jim Huggins&lt;/a&gt;. Exam
wrappers, in short, are merely when you require the students fill out something
for some credit when picking up their exams. The funny thing is that
it's a strategy that high school teachers have used for years without
a special name and we already knew the good and bad of it without the
research but that's not what I want to get at here. What I loved about
the talk, besides the fact that Ben and Michelle are clearly strong
presenters is that this was a negative result that was being
presented. I also loved the fact that they didn't present their
research as gospel but rather pointed out the strengths and weaknesses
of their approach - they made a case to what and why we should pay
attention to and what should be taken with a grain of salt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was a major breath of fresh air after being exposed to so much
education 'research' over the course of my life that the author or
presenter felt was just as strong as a mathematical proof rather than
an indication based on a specific experience or small set of
experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also felt a little weird at times during the week when west coast people seemed
to know me. I know I'm a loud mouthed curmudgeon and I go on my
periodic ed rants but given the dearth of comments on this blog I was
really surprised to get as many as "great to meet you in person after
reading your blog" or "we know you and your work" all week. It was
weird and somewhat humbling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, another highlight f`or me was that I got to catch up with
some of family.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/whiteboard-interviews/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
A few days ago, I saw a &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process%0A"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh"&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson's&lt;/a&gt; tweet on
whiteboard interviews:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello, my name is David. I would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. I look code up on the internet all the time. I don't do riddles.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/834146806594433025"&gt;February 21, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not a huge fan of the whiteboard interview but I think many of the
tweets missed the point. Most of the whiteboard interviews I'm
aware of involve algorithmic problem solving while the tweets, at
least the ones I've seen all refer to things that indeed one would
look up. Things like API calls - not things that whiteboard interviewers
typically care about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tim Bray takes that point of view and shared his thoughts in a
&lt;a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/03/04/Whiteboard-Interviews"&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The idea behind the whiteboard interview isn't all bad. The
interviewer has an opportunity to see how the candidate thinks and
works through a problem and in an ideal situation the interviewer is,
at least to a point, coaching the candidate to help them through the
process. It seems to me that the problem lies more in the types of
questions asked and the skill of the interviewer rather than the idea
that candidates work through a problem live.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'd imagine that whiteboard interview success skew towards candidates
who work well in isolation in a short period of time, have a good
amount of exposure to these types of algorithmic problems. Also those
who have practiced and trained specifically for the interview will
have a huge edge. For people new to the process, it can be very
stressful. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once a candidate has accepted a position, they'll likely be working
with a team, with additional resources, and with time to solve
problems. This is a very different environment.  The whiteboard
interview, much like the SAT is thus something of an arbitrary
gatekeeper that a candidate must prepare for and conquer rather than a
skill that they must develop that will make them a more productive
team member.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This whole process tends to advantage those with the time and
background to prepare - this is one of the places where the argument
that whiteboard interview hurt diversity come from.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I could be totally wrong but I seem to recall that the whiteboard
interview, at least in terms of external visibility grew out of the
legendary Google puzzle interview questions. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A tech giant like Google can interview however they like and they'll
still get the talent. They go to the most selective institutions where
candidates have already been culled for success. If they then interview 100
candidates and 10 of them would be good fits, as long as a couple
thrive through the whiteboard interview process, they'll get their
engineer. They'll miss out on a lot of great talent but they can cast
such a large net they'll fill there seats with productive employees. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, smaller companies will certainly miss out on great
talent if they follow the same approach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is there a better way?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some companies pre-assign mini projects and then discuss that at the
interview. Pairing could also be a lower stress alternative to the
technical interview. Another option would be to look at a candidates
existing projects. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An interesting question is "why do so many companies use the
whiteboard interview?" I can't say for certain but I wouldn't be
surprised if it was a simple as "because Google does it."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For over 100 years, Stuyvesant high school required students study
mechanical drawing (drafting). The relevance of the subject lessened over the
decades and what was taught in many ways has become a joke. A typical
class during the CAD parts of the class might be going over the
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;cylinder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; command in CadKey. That's like spending a day studying
the &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; menu in Microsoft Word in an English class. If you can't
tell, I'm not a fan. Drafting at Stuyvesant is the vestigial organ of
the course of study. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My point isn't to bash drafting at Stuy but rather that there have
been any number of schools that require their students take drafting
even though it doesn't prepare students for, nor lead them to anything
else in the schools curriculum (which now can be said for Stuy's
drafting requirement). I've spoken to teachers and principals at these
schools and we go back and forth as I press them for the reason for
the requirement and ultimately, they tell me that their school
requires drafting "because Stuyvesant does." 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why do so many small companies employ the whiteboard interview?
Because the big kids do. The trouble is that the big kids can get away
with it, the smaller players on the other hand, are hurting
themselves. Even the bigger players would be well served to 
try to come up with an interview process that better assesses fit
rather than a course filter that while it does pull in talent misses
talent as well.

    <title>Quality Devs and Coding Contests</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/</id>
    <updated>2017-02-19T16:53:56-05:00</updated>
    <published>2017-02-19T16:53:56-05:00</published>
    <author>
      <name>Mike Zamansky</name>
    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I've been planning to put together a response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;'s
recent post - &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html"&gt;Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR, although it isn't really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred's post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there's less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before getting to "does it matter," I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent &lt;a href="http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc"&gt;IOI results&lt;/a&gt; and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we're doing fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country's producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don't encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I've known some very smart and talented individuals
who've excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I've known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn't call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they're not the ones
who've gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they're not necessarily the ones who've
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they're only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock's laws of startups - &lt;a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team"&gt;law 9&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team"&gt;
&lt;img width="30%" src="http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like &lt;a href="https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/"&gt;Dream it. Code it. Win it.&lt;/a&gt;, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They'll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I'd love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I'd also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also think there's a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm working on building Hunter College's honors CS program and while I
can't move the Hunter curriculum, I'm seeking that balance in my own
way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will we get there? I don't know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we'll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we'll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn't be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won't do much, however for the
rest of the students. I'm not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there's a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don't seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won't become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon. 
&lt;/p&gt;

are but probably a smaller percent from that group than from the
general pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Starting with scheme</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy's intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don't recommend it in many
cases.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scheme certainly isn't mainstream. That's not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It's less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I've had a student with a background in Scheme, they've been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I like scheme because it's simple. It looks different than other
languages but is &lt;code&gt;(+ 3 4)&lt;/code&gt; really that different than &lt;code&gt;add(3,4)&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;3+4&lt;/code&gt;? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can tell kids "everything's a function." While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn't, it's close enough for our
purposes. Everything's a function and the way we write a function is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Apply function &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on arguments &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;b c …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. So we have &lt;code&gt;(+ 2 3)&lt;/code&gt; to
add 2 and 3, &lt;code&gt;(and a b)&lt;/code&gt; for logical and &lt;code&gt;(= 3 4)&lt;/code&gt; to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In scheme, it would be:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though we're fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;(lambda (a b) (+ a b))&lt;/code&gt; returns a function that adds &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; associates it with the identifier &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;add2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Now we
can use the function: &lt;code&gt;(add2 5 10)&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates to 15.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it's off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course this wouldn't work had DrScheme (now &lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn't as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with &lt;a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/"&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It also didn't hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don't get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where &lt;a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/"&gt;Bootstrapworld&lt;/a&gt;
is a terrific program).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any event, if you're a high school CS teacher and  haven't played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.

    <title>Selecting a starting language - why not Javascript</title>

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of "why don't you start them with Javascript?" 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I'd get similar pushback but then it
was "why not Java?", "why not C?", or "whu not C++?"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don't like Javascript as a first language and I thought I'd share some
of them here. I'll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start, let me say that I &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's dive in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquity and availability:

&lt;p&gt;
If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it's also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like &lt;a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"&gt;JSFiddle&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Interactivity:

&lt;p&gt;
You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's mainstream
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's quick to get up and running
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is all true, but there are also downsides.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like &lt;a href="http://www.drjava.org/"&gt;DrJava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/"&gt;DrPython&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven't found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There's no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;
which is pretty conventional, but then there's also &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 50 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//50&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  56&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '533'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '533&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '533'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For more, check out the this &lt;a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Start watching at about 1:20 -
it's a riot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript's got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it's easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the fact that Javascript's a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who've at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
"everyone knows this but me." A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It's just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Should CS Ed be in bed with the College Board</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</id>

&lt;p&gt;
I'm guessing my views  on this aren't very popular -that's OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren't careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we're well on our way down
that road.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE"&gt;STEM Oil Salesmen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE"&gt;Superficial PD and scripted curricula&lt;/a&gt;  and my concern that   
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE"&gt;we'll be done&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it's wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I'm seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other week I noticed, &lt;a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by &lt;a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which also highlights actually taking the exam.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This didn't sit well with me. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn't drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE"&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt;. The college credit thing? I'm
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I'm still skeptical
here. Placement? It's a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reasons not to take the exam?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it doesn't do anything for the kid, why take it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress of taking the exam
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the expense
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a general rule, I'm against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we've been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I've
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;fail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he's moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This follows last year's announcement that code.org was &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE"&gt;partnering with
the College Board&lt;/a&gt; - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn't do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It's
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't doubt code.org's sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I'm
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we'll regret years from now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

teacher training is OK, ask yourself if you want your own child's
chemistry teacher to be a history teacher with a few weeks summer
training in chemistry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.3" name="fn.3" class="footnum" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fnr.3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I'm guessing the exam will be offered
during the day so teachers will proctor for free rather than be
allowed to, you know, teach their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>BS? - BA</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ba-bs/</id>
    <updated>2017-01-01T20:14:25-05:00</updated>

I didn't know Hunter College had computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high
schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS's low
profile and small size in spite of its high quality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer
Science programs. I'd hear things like "but they only offer a BA not a
BS," or "but Hunter isn't an engineering school."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've come to realize that we have to do a better job educating kids as
to what can come next after high school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not entirely sure why many assume that CS has to be under
engineering. When I was applying to college, most of my choices were
Arts and Science schools offering BAs in CS. Maybe it's because people don't
disagregate STEM subjects. Even though it's not a computer science
program many schools seem to associate FIRST robotics with computer
science. Likewise any class with even a modicum of coding becomes
computer science and as makerspaces and robotics are a percieved as
easy entry STEM classes that appear to be CS (something I'll rant
about in a future post), CS becomes associated with engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's easy enough to explain the difference between a BA in CS and a BS
in CS and it's equally easy to show that you can have tremendous
success either way. All you have to do to show the validity of a BA in
CS is look at succesful people from places like NYU, Courant, Columbia
College (as opposed to Columbia Engineering), Cornell school of Arts
and Sciences, etc to balance successful people from the engineering schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I'm sure you know, I'm pretty high on Hunter CS and it's certainly
one of the best value CS educations out there. Personally, I'm a big believer in a
liberal arts education but in any case, as a community we have to do a
better job educating the high schools so that graduating seniors are
best informed when deciding on their futures.

    <title>It gets easier (or advent of code 2016 day 19)</title>

Today's &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/19"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; problem was a variant on the &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JosephusProblem.html"&gt;Josephus
problem&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I recalled that there was a formula to figure out the 
sole survivor but I decide to run a simulation rather than looking it
up. I also decided to write it up in C++, well, really C with cout
instead of printf.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part 1 was the traditional problem. Part 2 was a variant where at each
iteration, you remove the elf opposite the elf being processed (see
the &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/19"&gt;problem description&lt;/a&gt; for details).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For both solutions I coded up a circular doubly linked list:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;make_ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can see my complete solutions &lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2016/blob/master/day19.cpp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about how I wrote the code – I just rolled it off the
top of my head. The same was true for the earlier AoC problems where I
had to implement a breadth first search or something similar. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not making a statement about my amazing coding abilities - linked
lists and graph searches are pretty basic, but rather than having done
the CS thing for so long, these fundamentals have become somewhat
routine. I haven't really written C code in years but other than a
couple of typos (and a stupid mistake in calculating steps) things
worked right off the bat. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I remember a time when I was in college or even a young professional
when I would use an array and an index as a stack or queue - not
because it made more sense but rather, because I wasn't fully
comfortable with memory manipulation and linked lists. The same could
be said for my first few years working with anything more than the
simplest recursion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that it does get easier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Things that seem trivial to us now seemed
insurmountable when we were beginners. Last year, I wrote about an overnight homework
assignment I gave to my class that would have been a final project a
year earlier (the post is &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-11-taking-stock-self-assess.html/#.WFiGl99iekA"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but the homework links are no longer
active) and a few weeks ago I recall a fellow CS teacher talking about
how much longer it takes his students to write a chunk of code than it
takes the teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
New things are challenging and take time but with practice and
persistence techniques that were once daunting can become tools ready
at our disposal to use on a whim.

I'm spending the weekend up in Michigan. Visiting my brother and is
family. We're here to see the &lt;a href="http://umgass.org"&gt;UMGASS&lt;/a&gt; production of Gilbert and
Sullivan's &lt;a href="http://www.umgass.org/current-production"&gt;The Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. Batya also came up from Cornell to join us so
the two families are all togehter for the first time in about 10
years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This hasn't left much time for &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; but I did manage to
finish yesterday's challenge this morning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What took me so long? Much like last year, it was &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/"&gt;because I'm an
idiot&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9"&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; seemed pretty straighforward. I coded a solution and it
worked for all the test cases. I tried it on my data set but
the grader said the answer was wrong. I went through the problem a
number of times as well sa my code. I figured I either mis-interpreted
the question or had some bug. I found neither to be true.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After some frustration, I went over to the Advent of Code &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/"&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt;
grabbed a couple of posted solutions (trying not to look at them) and
ran both on my data - those solutions got the same answer on my data
set as I did. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I asked Batya to look over my code and the problem (it's
always good to have a daughter that's smarted than you are) but she
saw no problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I emailed my buddy JonAlf since I know he completed the problem. He sent back his answer along
with his data set and I got the same answer as he did on his data.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What could be the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
His data set was about 12k characters long, mine was 4k. Something had
to be wrong here. I went back to the Advent of Code site and grabbed
the data set again. This time, I went to the page and did a "save-as"
to save it - last time, I cut and pasted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The cut and paste version was 4k, the save-as was 12k. This time it
worked and was accepted and I also finished part 2 in short order.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The moral of the story – make sure you check the integrity of your
data set - you'll never get the right answer if you're working with
the wrong data.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In case anyone's interested, you can find my AoC code &lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2016"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Today we're looking at &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; 2016 &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2"&gt;number 2&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To change things up, I thought I'd do a video where I live code a solution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The solution I present is pretty straightforward - use a 2D array (or
technically, an array of strings) to represent the keypad, parse the
input, and follow the input instructions to build the code. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I really like about Advent of Code is that every
problem has two parts and depending on how you solved part 1, you may
or may not have extra work to do for part 2.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years ago, I wrote about one of the coding techniques I
try to convey to my students. The idea of &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data.md"&gt;changing the data&lt;/a&gt; to take
away edge and special cases. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part two of this problem is a perfect time to use that technique.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the video, I hope you enjoy it:

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I recently &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-of-code-2016/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; - a series of programming
problems relseased one a day. While they vary in terms of level of
difficulty, a number of them make nice problems for introductory to
mid level programming classes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on a few of them starting with
the first problem from this years competition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1"&gt;Take a minute to read it over.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At first glance, it might seem to a young programmer that this problem
requires a two dimensional array - all about (x,y) coordinates but
then there's a problem - there are no limits on coordinates and we
can't make an unlimited size array.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After thinking a bit, hopefully the programmer realizes that all they
need to do is keep track of the how the &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(x,y)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; location changes over
time. In the solution below, we start at &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(0,0)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and count the steps as
we update two variables &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When we finish processing the moves, we have our current location in
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(x,y)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and we have the number of steps taken to get there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The solution below hsa a couple of niceties that a beginning
programmer might not know or use (and I'm not arguing that what's written is
superior in any way, it's just what I ended up writing).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I make use of tuple destructuring:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
which assigns &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the first item in the tuple and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the
second. I used that a number of times 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also use a list  I call &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;dirs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to hold dx and dy values for the
four direcitons:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This made it easier to to update the location based on the 4
directions. I could also have just used if statements.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's all the code:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# assume our starting location is 0,0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# we start with d=0 -&amp;gt; facing north&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# as we turn left or right, we can just increment or decrement d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and dirs[d] will give us the appropriate dx and dy to update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# our locatoin for the next step&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is only needed for part 2  - We track visited locations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# by adding them to the dictionary. If we try to add a location&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# that's already been visited we know that we've found our final &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# location&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# locs={}  # uncomment this line for part 2&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;totalsteps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the first char in i is the direction to turn in (L or R)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the rest represents the number of steps.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:])&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"L"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;totalsteps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;totalsteps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Uncomment this block for part 2&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# each time we have a new location, see if it's already in&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# locs, if it isn't, add it.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if it is, we're visiting somewhere twice so we're done.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#if ((x,y) not in locs):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    locs[(x,y)]=1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#else:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    print((x,y))&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    print(abs(x)+abs(y)) # the answer&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    sys.exit(0)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    break&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Overall, a nice little problem for beginning and intermediate
students.

    <title>Advent of Code 2016</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Once again, it's time for &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; - a series of small
programming problems released once a day. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a bit about it &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-15-advent.html/"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/#.WEMqBB9ieYQ"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt; and you can still find last years
problems &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2015/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice
for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I'm thinking of
looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I didn't think about this much last year but one thing I really like
about the competition is that each problem comes in two parts. You're
first presented with the problem and the input and once you put in the
correct answer, you're presented with part two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This can be annoying at times, particularly when it requires a large
code rewrite but it also means that well designed, not too specific
solutions are rewarded. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not quite the same as changing the specs on a project mid way but
it does encourage thinking about more than just solving a super
specific problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Check out &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; and see if it's something you or your classes
might enjoy.

    <title>Inverted Index Project</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/inverted-index/</id>
    <updated>2016-11-26T16:52:56-05:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't spoken much about the class I've been teaching this
semester. It's an intro CS course - a programming heavy intro. I
decided to use Python with a transition at the end to C++. The
transition is to mirror Hunter's normal first CS course that ends with
a C++ intro to prepare the students for next semester's CS course
which is a more intense OOP class using C++ - the language we use in
our core courses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Throughout the semester I've tried to use a variety of interesting
application areas so as to try to give the students some idea of the
possibilities that studying CS will open up for them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After covering Python dictionaries and lists I thought we'd play by
building an inverted Index.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basic idea is to map a set of words back to source files. For
example, given the following four one line files:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"&gt;


&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class="left"&gt;

&lt;col class="left"&gt;

&lt;col class="left"&gt;

&lt;col class="left"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt;files&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt;contents&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;if you prick us do we not bleed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.02&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;if you tickle us do we not laugh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;if you poison us do we not die and&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;if you wrong us shall we not revenge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
You could build a data structure mapping each word back to the file(s)
that contain it (partially shown here),
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"&gt;


&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class="left"&gt;

&lt;col class="left"&gt;

&lt;col class="left"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt;Word&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="left"&gt;Files containing It's&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;if&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;you&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;prick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;do&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="left"&gt;file.01 file.02 file.03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
You can, of course, store more information - how many times a word
appears in a file, where it appears, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a fairly easy structure to build. A dictionary where the keys
are the words in the file and the values are lists of the documents
containing the words.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;inverted_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'if'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.01'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.02'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.03'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.04'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'you'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.01'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.02'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.03'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.04'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'prick'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.01'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'us'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.01'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.02'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.03'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.04'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'do'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.01'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.02'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'file.03'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In addition to letting us work with dictionaries and lists, we can
also review file access and even the python CSV module if we want.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can immediately write simple queries – "what document(s) contain
the word 'prick,' but things get more interesting if you write
functions to perform &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; queries - "what document(s)
contain the words 'prick' &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 'do'" for instance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why are we building this (besides as a data structure and programming
exercise)? I've seen a number of references to using an inverted index
when building a web search engine. In fact, I think that's something
you do early on in the Udacity Mooc. I just wanted to play with
information retrieval.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I remembered that there was a collection of information, including
last statements from &lt;a href="https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html"&gt;executed offenders in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Someone conveniently
converted it into a &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAjZTtPriClY-X3n9whTkA4i5D7bn3bmtHnLoaVICvI/edit#gid=1"&gt;Google Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;. The format's a little
different from our simple four file example but then there's more
data. It's straightforward enough to download the spreadsheet as a CSV
file and then read it with a Python program that builds it into an
inverted index.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now we have some interesting data to play with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How many offenders used words like "sorry" or "apologize?" How about
references to religion? We can do all sorts of &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
queries. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We just played with this a bit but I could see all sorts of
explorations. What about taking some great work of literature and
turning it into an inverted index by chapter. You could query
characters or certain words and see where and when they appear in the
book. A new and different way of exploring literature.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, there you have it - an interesting little project we played with
this past semester. We did it in an intro Python course but I could
see it as an interesting project in AP CS A using hashmaps and lists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I spent this evening as a crit advisor for this semesters &lt;a href="http://tech.cornell.edu/studio/curriculum/product-studio"&gt;Project
Studio&lt;/a&gt;. The class is basically a finishing class for their Masters
students. The class forms teams that work with a "company champion"
that acts an advisor to build a product.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a Crit Advisor, I, along with two other people from the tech
industry have a give and take with three groups and hopefully we can
provide useful feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a "tech industry person" I feel a bit like an outsider since I'm
really the "teacher guy," but I think I had some worthwhile things to
share with the groups.  Besides,
I'd like to think I'm sufficiently in touch with the tech industry
through "the family" to be a reasonably sound advisor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, two of the groups I worked with had an education bent
so at least in terms of product they were in my wheelhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't want to talk specifically about the student products since I
didn't ask permission but I did want to share a few thoughts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The products reminded me very much of the projects my Stuy kids
produced in their senior SoftDev class. This is not to belittle the
Cornell Tech people but rather noting how advanced the work of the
Stuy kids is. Beyond that, I liked the composition of the groups I
talked to - nice combinations of skill sets and backgrounds. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I love the idea of the mentoring company which had an interesting effect on
the groups. In all cases, the mentoring company helped provide the
teams with an idea framework but in one case, I think the company's point of
view actually limited the groups vision a bit. This came up in our
discussions and I'm hoping that the students got something out of
that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also liked the crit review I was part of - bringing in outsiders to
show your work to and to get feedback from. It would probably hard
logistically at Stuy, but I'll talk to the guys there about the
concept. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I shared my contact info with the two groups that asked and if they
follow up, I'd love to be a resource for them. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm also looking forward to taking part in more events like this in
the future.

    <title>Computational Thinkers in Scotland</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</id>
    <updated>2016-09-30T07:28:53-04:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I'm way behind on my &lt;a href="http://cacm.acm.org/"&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/a&gt;. I generally only read
them when I use my trainer in the mornings and with summer running and
outside riding, I'm still on the December 2015 issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on &lt;a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/12/194638-creating-a-new-generation-of-computational-thinkers/abstract"&gt;a
program in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. If you're an ACM member, and if you're a CS
practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
Me? I noticed a number of similarities between what Bundy and Scott
described and efforts here in the USA including some of the red flags.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not here to talk about the program described in detail or their
successes and failures. I don't have enough information to fairly
comment on that. I'm here in my usual role of curmudgeon to highlight
common red flags that if unheeded could cost all of us the opportunity
to get really great CS Ed to all of our students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One red flag right away were a number of references to the program
being curriculum and materials driven, not teacher driven. The
viewpoint states that materials "were designed to be used by even
non-specialist teachers." We see the same thing here in the USA and
not just in CS Ed. Teaching overall is being devalued with the elite
pushing programs that handcuff good teachers to a script (which leads
students towards "success" in passing a nonsense standardized exam)
all the while sending their own kids to elite private schools with
knowledgeable teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know i didn't want my kids to be taught chemistry history or any
other subject by a teacher that hasn't studied the content yet here we
go saying it's okay for CS. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The counter argument is that we have to do something now and we'll do
better later. We all go in with the best of intentions but more often
than not, once a politician has their sound bite and once a cheap
apparent solution is in place, it's good enough and we're done. I
ranted about that a while back both &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.V-5UqN9vGAk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.V-5Uot9vGAk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To their credit,
Bundy and Scott talk a bit about this concern in the piece.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The piece also said "It is also necessary to employ a pedagogy that is
informed by the latest research into the most effective ways to teach
computing." This sounds good but the truth is, education research
doesn't have the best reputation among educators. Last month, I
asked one of the best math teachers around what was being bandied
about as best practices in math education according to "the
research?" He basically said "the research says do &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;fad du jour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
but that doesn't work for me so I just do &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;actually good technique&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I've spoken to many teachers and by and large the best
ones discredit "the research." Of course, my comment will be
discredited by ed researchers saying that "you're just giving
anecdotes" but then, if I did the same thing while employed as a
researcher, did a couple of surveys and submitted it for publication,
then it would be "research." So much of teaching is a craft and the
truth is, practitioners know best.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Related to this is authentication by citing authority. Particularly
dangerous in our field because many people with little to no real
background in teaching CS are anointed as experts and thought leaders
(see this post: &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, the viewpoint cites Cameron
Fadjo. I've only met Cameron once or twice and he seems like a sharp
guy but when he was given the post of Director of Software Engineering
for NYC, according to his linked in profile, he had neither taught k12
nor had any real CS background.  This is of course the profile of many
CS Education thought leaders. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My overall take. It sounds like just like here, Scotland has people
trying to make a difference and trying to do good. It also sounds like
they're falling into the same traps and pitfalls as we are on this
side of the Atlantic.

    <title>Can NYCIST become in leader in CS Education?</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/nycist/</id>
    <updated>2016-09-24T16:17:53-04:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I only learned about NYCIST last spring. They're the "New York
Consortium for Independent School Technologists." They had something
of an open house that I attended. I heard about them from friend
and fellow CS educator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ed_saber"&gt;Saber Khan&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last Thursday I spent an afternoon and evening with NYCIST members for
a discussion of the state of K12 Computer Science Education in the
City.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most of my work has been with public schools and most of the teachers
I know, public school teachers so it was great to make new friends in
the Independent school community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One thing I realized during the evening was that NYCIST has a real
opportunity to do something special. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, the public schools are leading the way in computer
science education as a result of this administrations CS4All
initiative but at the same time, public schools face some real
challenges. While some "early adopters" have developed their own take
on computer science education, by and large, CS4All is being defined
and driven by few for all and, at least right now, the model seems to
be the "a little PD and you're a CS teacher" model.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, standardized testing and teacher evaluations are
pressuring schools, particularly schools of our most vulnerable
students to push resources towards test prep in tested subjects rather
than real education, including CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this particular instance, NYCIST and independent schools can be
what charter schools were supposed to be before they were corrupted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Laboratories of innovation. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NYCIST has already gathered together interested parties and the
independent schools aren't burdened by the weight of politically
driven testing and teacher evaluation. At the same time, small class
sizes and flexible models allow for innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If they wanted to, they could probably create curricular and
instructional frameworks for CS education and. dare I say it, share it
back to the public schools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know I'm ignoring independent school politics and other issues that
would prevent this from happening, but I just feel that if there's a
desire to do so from a group like NYCIST, it could happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm looking forward to continuing to work with my new friends and if
any of you are interested in finding out more about NYCIST, just tweet
to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ed_saber"&gt;Saber&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if my idea here will take root but if it does, I'd love
to work with NYCIST to make something happen.
