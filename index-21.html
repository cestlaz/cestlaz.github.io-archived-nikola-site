    <p>
Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of <a href="http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/">Navajo Math Circles</a>, a
documentary on a <a href="http://www.mathcircles.org/">Math Circle</a> put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
</p>

<p>
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I'm most familiar with the <a href="https://www.nymathcircle.org/">New York Math Circle</a>. I'm friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
</p>

<p>
As someone who's worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they've started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what's
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
</p>

<p>
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it's something
we're losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
"making the work interesting and relevant to the student" but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
</p>

<p>
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
</p>


<p>
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
</p>

<p>
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks. 
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what's the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Math Circle is fun!!!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think that says it all.
</p>

<p>
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son's best teachers, <a href="http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx">Paula Rogovin</a> did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder. 
</p>

<p>
Until we win back public education it's important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
<a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>) and it's also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.

<p>
Now that we're past the intro material, we'll start looking at emacs
features one at a time. This will let you focus on using the one
feature we're covering, fit it into your work flow, and really get
comfortable with it. 
</p>

<p>
This time we'll dive into using Emacs effectively with buffers.
</p>

<p>
Watch the video and then make a real effort to use buffers over the
next few emacs sessions. Before you know it, they'll be a natural part
of your work flow.
</p>

<p>
The idea of incrementally learning a tool this way seems to be called
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/developing-emacs-micro-habits-text-automation/">developing micro-habits</a> and I first read about the idea from <a href="https://twitter.com/sachac">Sacha
Chua</a> who is an amazing member of the emacs community.
</p>

<p>
When seeing beginners, I'll frequently observe this work flow:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Open a terminal
</li>
<li>Load emacs on a file
</li>
<li>Edit the file
</li>
<li>Save and quit emacs
</li>
<li>Try to compile and run the program (since usually this is in a programming class)
</li>
<li>repeat
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the beginner needs to see multiple files at once, they fire up multiple separate emacs.
</p>

<p>
All of this causes me physical pain.
</p>

<p>
In emacs, your editor can load several buffers at once, each
associated with a separate file. You can quickly switch between them,
search across them, and more. The video will get you started.
</p>

<p>
The video also mentions <b>ido</b> mode. To set up <b>ido</b> mode, add the
following code to your init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">ido-enable-flex-matching</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">ido-everywhere</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">ido-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
And here's a great little write up on it by <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide">Mickey Petersen</a>:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode">https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode</a>
</p>


<p>
As I mentioned in the video, I actually use another mode for completions (<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">swiper</a>),
which I'll cover in a future video and another popular option is <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a>
which we'll also cover.
</p>

<p>
For buffers, the keys to remember are:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="left">
<col class="left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">Key</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Command</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x b</td>
<td class="left">switch-buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x C-b</td>
<td class="left">list-buffers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
To use ibuffer, which is more powerful than list-buffers you can add
either:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defalias</span> <span class="ss">'list-buffers</span> <span class="ss">'ibuffer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; make ibuffer default</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Or if you want to open ibuffer in another Window:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defalias</span> <span class="ss">'list-buffers</span> <span class="ss">'ibuffer-other-window</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; make ibuffer default</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Here are a couple of useful links on ibuffer and buffer switching:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_buffer_switching.html">http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_buffer_switching.html</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://mytechrants.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/emacs-tip-of-the-day-start-using-ibuffer-asap/">https://mytechrants.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/emacs-tip-of-the-day-start-using-ibuffer-asap/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, if you like a tab bar, you can add the following to your
init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">tabbar</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tabbar-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
There's also a package <a href="https://github.com/mattfidler/tabbar-ruler.el">tabbar-ruler</a> which is supposed to make the
tabbar look nicer but since I don't use the tabbar at all, I haven't
checked it out.
</p>

<p>
Hope this gets you using emacs more effectively.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for our next video on window management.

<p>
Many people think of Emacs as an editor. I like to think of it as an Elisp interpreter where you live code documents.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, it's like those new fangled interactive programming environments where you type in code and the updates are reflected instantly. 
</p>

<p>
In this video, I try to explain the way I think about Emacs and why it's so cool.
</p>

<p>
The only change we made to our configuration was adding:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tool-bar-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Which gets rid of the tool bar at the top.
</p>

<p>
Next time, we start talking about efficiently using Emacs.

<p>
This video is a brief introduction to org-mode, a mode I use for all
sorts of things.
</p>

<p>
We'll dive into org-mode later in the series. Right now I just want
you to see the basics since we'll be using org-mode for any notes that
are written up during this series. 
</p>

<p>
Actually, all my blog posts are written in org-mode.
</p>

<p>
Here are the important lines to add to your Emacs <b>init.el</b> file  to
get the nice looking bullets when in org-mode:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">org-bullets</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-mode-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-bullets-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
About a month ago, Emacs user Harry Schwartz gave a nice overview talk
on org-mode. If you want to get a better idea as to all the things you
can do with it, check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4</a>
</p>

<p>
Next time, we'll look at a little Elisp. After that, we'll dive in to
using Emacs effectively and efficiently.
