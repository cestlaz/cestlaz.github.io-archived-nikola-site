I spent last Saturday up at the Microsoft offices in Times Square
observing a <a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a> training session. My fried <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielgranor">Nathaniel Granor</a>, Teals
Regional Manager in the east has invited me a number of times and this
time I was able to make it.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know, TEALS is a program that takes volunteers in the
tech industry and places them in classrooms. Unlike other programs,
the TEALS volunteers work with the teachers while the kids learn some
CS. The idea is that the teacher will learn about CS from the
volunteer and the volunteer will learn something about teaching.
</p>

<p>
It's not the same as having a strong, knowledgeable CS teacher in the
classroom but until we get there, TEALS is doing great work giving
kids something that they need and otherwise wouldn't get.
</p>

<p>
At one point, Nathaniel started to talk to the volunteers about lesson
plans emphasizing the fact that TEALS would provide all the lesson materials and
the plans so these new to teaching tech volunteers wouldn't have to
make curricular decisions. 
</p>

<p>
The lesson plan form was pretty traditional and pretty formulaic:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>warm up
</li>
<li>hook
</li>
<li>instruction 
</li>
<li>practice
</li>
<li>Assessment
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Very similar to what I was shown back in the day during my two day
"teaching boot camp" that kicked off my career <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/lesson-plans/#fn.1">1</a></sup> and very
appropriate as an effective and efficient way to prepare these
volunteers for their first days. 
</p>

<p>
This got me thinking about my lesson planning over the years.
</p>

<p>
When I started, I was teaching math but I wasn't really a math
guy - I was CS all the way. I had to remember the math from high
school, learn the new topics, and figure out how to teach it.
</p>

<p>
I had a very supportive department but they were busy with their own
classes and this was pre internet. Fortunately, the NYC DOE published
lesson plan books. They were basically bound volumes of xerox copies
of hand written and typed lesson plans provided by experienced
teachers.
</p>

<p>
I spent many hours copying them, studying  them, and then later
tweaking them.
</p>

<p>
They were a life saver back then. How was the teaching? OK. Not
great. I got the material to the kids but I was nothing special. This
is where I started to form my bias against the scripted teaching
that's being pushed down today.
</p>

<p>
As I developed my chops, I started to design my own experiences for my
classes and things improved. By the time I was done teaching math -
maybe 4 years in, I was just scratching the surface of being a math
teacher.
</p>

<p>
One year in, I started teaching CS along with math at Seward
Park. When I was bumped to Stuy, I went back to math for  a year and a
half and then it was all CS all the time.
</p>

<p>
For CS, we didn't have lesson plan books so I had to craft everything
from scratch. It was a lot of work but the results were much better.
</p>

<p>
At first, I would actually write out lesson plans a la math lesson
plans. A "do now," "instructional objectives," "applications,"
"Homework," etc. The only thing I never formally wrote out was a
"medial summary."
</p>

<p>
Over time, my lessons got better but my lesson plans looked worse and
worse. 
</p>

<p>
There were times a lesson plan might look something like this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/lesson-plans/plan.jpg" alt="plan.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
OK, not exactly but as I developed at my craft, I didn't need a laid
out script to follow line for line  rather, just a set of little
reminders and maybe some printed out code. If we were going to develop
a complicated algorithm or derivation, though, I would still write out
all the steps.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't mean that as my career progressed I planned any less. It
might appear that I'm winging it but even if little to nothing is
written down, there is a plan and there's always a lot of pre work
before class begins.
</p>

<p>
Now, to bring this back to TEALS.
</p>

<p>
It's interesting how what's good in one context is not so much in
another.
</p>

<p>
What TEALS is doing is great - they've got to get a lot of
technologists in to classrooms quickly but once there, they'll be with
real, hopefully experienced teachers. What they're doing gets them
ready to go. It's a starting point, not an end.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, when I see scripted curriculum being sold as the
special sauce, be it in CS teacher "training," Teach for America
summer prep or in the name of charter school uniformity, I run the
other way.
</p>

<p>
Let's prepare curricular  materials for important programs like TEALS
and for beginning teachers just starting out but let's not confuse a
scripted lesson that can be delivered by one and all to be anything
close to the work of a master educator and craftsman.

The other day my friend and fellow CS Ed Blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a> wrote
about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/06/better-comments-in-visual-studio.html">Better Comments</a>, an extension for visual studio that displays
comments that are marked up  with special characters in order to
highlight them. Here's a screenshot:

<p>
So, the first thing I though was "I bet emacs could do that pretty
easily" and down the rabbit hole I went.
</p>

<p>
I had to figure out something about how emacs themes and font-locking
(emacs for syntax highlighting) works and of course spent far too much
time learning about Emacs, my favored tool, rather than getting actual
work done, but I came up with this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">make-face</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-important</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">set-face-foreground</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-important</span> <span class="s">"#00ff00"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">make-face</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-todo</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">set-face-foreground</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-todo</span> <span class="s">"#ff0000"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">make-face</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-strike</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">set-face-attribute</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-strike</span>
		    <span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="nv">:strike-through</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defun</span> <span class="nv">add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="s">"adds a few special keywords"</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">font-lock-add-keywords</span> 
   <span class="nv">nil</span>
   <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">"cx \\(.+\\)"</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-strike</span> <span class="nv">prepend</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ct \\(.+\\)"</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-todo</span> <span class="nv">prepend</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ci \\(.+\\)"</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-important</span> <span class="nv">prepend</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'python-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'js2-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'js-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
It's a hack but it does indeed work. In action, it looks something
like this:
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3TLw1yOMKMc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Truth be told, it really colors anything following cx, ct, or ci, not
just in comments – I have to look a bit more into how emacs handles
comments to figure that one out.
</p>

<p>
In any event, even though I spent too much time doing this, it's nice
to know I'm working in a tool in which I can.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>UPDATE:</b></b> Thanks to user ncsuwolf on /r/emacs on reddit, here's a

This video is all about using incremental search to navigate through your emacs buffers.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mwwN0S1dnQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
You can use the default incremental searchb, bound to <b><b>C-s</b></b> for
isearch-forward <b><b>C-r</b></b> to search backwards (reverse).
</p>

<p>
They work really well as is but I prefer using <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Swiper</a>. The video demos
both and the <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Swiper</a> home page has loads of details.
</p>

<p>
Part of the Swiper package includes ivy and counsel which I use instead of ido.
</p>

<p>
The video also mentions lorem-ipsum mode for generating text quickly and <b><b>describe-mode</b></b> in the help system.

    <p>
I received an email from a friend the other day asking me about a
particular robotics platform she recently saw.
</p>

<p>
I've played with robotics on and off over the years ranging from
building them from (not using) scratch using Atmel chips and programming them in
assembly to using Arduino based platforms to using pre-built robot
platforms. They're really cool and since they interact with the real
world you can do all sorts of interesting and motivational things with students.
</p>

<p>
I've done these on my own as a hobbyist and also with students either
individually or in small groups, but never as part of a class I had
been teaching.
</p>

<p>
Why not?
</p>

<p>
The biggest reason is that the classes I've taught are already so
packed full of CS goodness that we can't even get everything done
that's theoretically on the syllabi.
</p>

<p>
The other has to do with practical concerns.
</p>

<p>
Equipment costs - Let's say we can get our platform at $100 a pop. I
just can't see a public school with 34 kids in a class getting one per
student or one for every two.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the robot to student ratio and how much actual access do
the kids get? If they're designing  building, do they all get to
design and build? Same question with coding and operating.
</p>

<p>
Then there's space – if we're talking about a mobile platform as
opposed to something that sits on the desk and is near stationary, we
have a problem. The classrooms I've taught in can barely hold the
students.
</p>

<p>
There are also issues with breakage, loss, theft and long term
maintainability - will we be able to or even want to fill in with
compatible units in a few years as needed or will we have to reboot
the program from scratch.
</p>

<p>
All that to deal with before we even get to the fun of teaching and learning.
</p>

<p>
I'm really curious about the experiences of those of you who do teach
using robots and similar platforms. 
</p>

<p>
If you are such a teacher, could you please fill out this form or
leave a comment for anything that the form doesn't cover?

Sorry for the delay in getting this next video / post up. I spent the
last part of last week at <a href="http://go.personaldemocracy.com/">The Personal Democracy Forum 2016</a> which is really an exceptional conference.
</p>

<p>
I posted a bit about it in my <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pdf2016-lost-in-the-silo/#.V2B9th9vGAk">last post</a> and plan to write some more on it, but for now, more Emacs.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6OUMVbPKSA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>
This video concerns using windows. By using buffers and windows and
the basics you got from the tutorial, you shouldn't have to ever leave emacs.
</p>

<p>
From here, we'll be able to start going over effective Emacs and then
using it for things like development or document creation.
</p>


<p>
Some of the key window bindings:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="left">
<col class="left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">key</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">what it does</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x 2</td>
<td class="left">split-window-below (vertically)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x 3</td>
<td class="left">split-window-right (horizontally)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x 0</td>
<td class="left">delete-window (this one)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x 1</td>
<td class="left">delete-other-windows</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x o</td>
<td class="left">other-window (moves foxus to the next window</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
You also have frames which use <b><b>C-x 5</b></b> as the prefix, so <b><b>C-x 5 2</b></b>
creats a new frame and <b><b>C-x 5 1</b></b> closes the other frames.
</p>

<p>
Remember, you can always use the help system, in particular <b><b>C-x k</b></b>
to describe a key and <b><b>C-x f</b></b> to describe a function.
</p>


<p>
<b><b>C-x o</b></b> can be a little clunky so some people like to use
<b><b>windmove</b></b> which lets you move between windows by holding the shift
key and with the arrows. To set that up, you can add this to your
<b><b>init.el</b></b> 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">windmove-default-keybindings</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I prefer using <b><b>ace-window</b></b> mode which still uses <b><b>C-x o</b></b>:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">; add this to init.el</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">ace-window</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">progn</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-set-key</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">remap</span> <span class="nv">other-window</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ss">'ace-window</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">custom-set-faces</span>
     <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">aw-leading-char-face</span>
       <span class="p">((</span><span class="nf">t</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">:inherit</span> <span class="nv">ace-jump-face-foreground</span> <span class="nv">:height</span> <span class="mf">3.0</span><span class="p">)))))</span> 
    <span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The other mode I mention in the video is winner mode:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">winner-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Which will allow you to use <b><b>C-c left or right</b></b> to move through past
window configurations.

I spent the last couple of days attending <a href="http://go.personaldemocracy.com/">Personal Democracy Forum
2016</a>, described on their landing site as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The world’s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology's
impact on politics, government, and society.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's the reason why I haven't posted my latest Emacs video.
</p>

<p>
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important
issues. I'll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks. 
</p>

<p>
One topic that I've already lamented about has been the way we as a
society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms
like Facebook.
</p>

<p>
I use Facebook as much as the next guy but it always irks me when I
see a CS Education post followed by rich discussion hidden within
Facebook's walls and not available for discovery to the outside world
and the future.
</p>

<p>
I generally don't get a lot of comments on my posts, but when I do,
more appear in the Facebook link to my post rather than publicly on
the post itself.
</p>

<p>
At the conference, we watched a video by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan">Hossein Derakhshan</a> which
talked about the direction the web is moving in and the red flags it
should raise with all of us. He echoed my concerns and beyond but in a much more
eloquent way.
</p>

<p>
I'm urging you to take the less than ten minutes to watch this
video. I know school's winding down for all of us but for those of you
who are teachers out there - share this with your students. I'm sure a
rich discussion will follow.

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of <a href="http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/">Navajo Math Circles</a>, a
documentary on a <a href="http://www.mathcircles.org/">Math Circle</a> put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
</p>

<p>
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I'm most familiar with the <a href="https://www.nymathcircle.org/">New York Math Circle</a>. I'm friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
</p>

<p>
As someone who's worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they've started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what's
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
</p>

<p>
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it's something
we're losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
"making the work interesting and relevant to the student" but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
</p>

<p>
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
</p>


<p>
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
</p>

<p>
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks. 
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what's the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Math Circle is fun!!!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think that says it all.
</p>

<p>
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son's best teachers, <a href="http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx">Paula Rogovin</a> did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder. 
</p>

<p>
Until we win back public education it's important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
<a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>) and it's also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.

<p>
Now that we're past the intro material, we'll start looking at emacs
features one at a time. This will let you focus on using the one
feature we're covering, fit it into your work flow, and really get
comfortable with it. 
</p>

<p>
This time we'll dive into using Emacs effectively with buffers.
</p>

<p>
Watch the video and then make a real effort to use buffers over the
next few emacs sessions. Before you know it, they'll be a natural part
of your work flow.
</p>

<p>
The idea of incrementally learning a tool this way seems to be called
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/developing-emacs-micro-habits-text-automation/">developing micro-habits</a> and I first read about the idea from <a href="https://twitter.com/sachac">Sacha
Chua</a> who is an amazing member of the emacs community.
</p>

<p>
When seeing beginners, I'll frequently observe this work flow:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Open a terminal
</li>
<li>Load emacs on a file
</li>
<li>Edit the file
</li>
<li>Save and quit emacs
</li>
<li>Try to compile and run the program (since usually this is in a programming class)
</li>
<li>repeat
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the beginner needs to see multiple files at once, they fire up multiple separate emacs.
</p>

<p>
All of this causes me physical pain.
</p>

<p>
In emacs, your editor can load several buffers at once, each
associated with a separate file. You can quickly switch between them,
search across them, and more. The video will get you started.
</p>

<p>
The video also mentions <b>ido</b> mode. To set up <b>ido</b> mode, add the
following code to your init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">ido-enable-flex-matching</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">ido-everywhere</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">ido-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
And here's a great little write up on it by <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide">Mickey Petersen</a>:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode">https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode</a>
</p>


<p>
As I mentioned in the video, I actually use another mode for completions (<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">swiper</a>),
which I'll cover in a future video and another popular option is <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a>
which we'll also cover.
</p>

<p>
For buffers, the keys to remember are:

<p>
To use ibuffer, which is more powerful than list-buffers you can add
either:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defalias</span> <span class="ss">'list-buffers</span> <span class="ss">'ibuffer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; make ibuffer default</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Or if you want to open ibuffer in another Window:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defalias</span> <span class="ss">'list-buffers</span> <span class="ss">'ibuffer-other-window</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; make ibuffer default</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Here are a couple of useful links on ibuffer and buffer switching:

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, if you like a tab bar, you can add the following to your
init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">tabbar</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tabbar-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
There's also a package <a href="https://github.com/mattfidler/tabbar-ruler.el">tabbar-ruler</a> which is supposed to make the
tabbar look nicer but since I don't use the tabbar at all, I haven't
checked it out.
</p>

<p>
Hope this gets you using emacs more effectively.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for our next video on window management.

<p>
Many people think of Emacs as an editor. I like to think of it as an Elisp interpreter where you live code documents.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, it's like those new fangled interactive programming environments where you type in code and the updates are reflected instantly. 
</p>

<p>
In this video, I try to explain the way I think about Emacs and why it's so cool.
</p>

<p>
The only change we made to our configuration was adding:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tool-bar-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Which gets rid of the tool bar at the top.
</p>

<p>
Next time, we start talking about efficiently using Emacs.

<p>
This video is a brief introduction to org-mode, a mode I use for all
sorts of things.
</p>

<p>
We'll dive into org-mode later in the series. Right now I just want
you to see the basics since we'll be using org-mode for any notes that
are written up during this series. 
</p>

<p>
Actually, all my blog posts are written in org-mode.
</p>

<p>
Here are the important lines to add to your Emacs <b>init.el</b> file  to
get the nice looking bullets when in org-mode:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">org-bullets</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-mode-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-bullets-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
About a month ago, Emacs user Harry Schwartz gave a nice overview talk
on org-mode. If you want to get a better idea as to all the things you
can do with it, check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4</a>
</p>

<p>
Next time, we'll look at a little Elisp. After that, we'll dive in to
using Emacs effectively and efficiently.
