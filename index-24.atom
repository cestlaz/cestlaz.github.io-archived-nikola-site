    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I spent this evening as a crit advisor for this semesters &lt;a href="http://tech.cornell.edu/studio/curriculum/product-studio"&gt;Project
Studio&lt;/a&gt;. The class is basically a finishing class for their Masters
students. The class forms teams that work with a "company champion"
that acts an advisor to build a product.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a Crit Advisor, I, along with two other people from the tech
industry have a give and take with three groups and hopefully we can
provide useful feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a "tech industry person" I feel a bit like an outsider since I'm
really the "teacher guy," but I think I had some worthwhile things to
share with the groups.  Besides,
I'd like to think I'm sufficiently in touch with the tech industry
through "the family" to be a reasonably sound advisor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, two of the groups I worked with had an education bent
so at least in terms of product they were in my wheelhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't want to talk specifically about the student products since I
didn't ask permission but I did want to share a few thoughts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The products reminded me very much of the projects my Stuy kids
produced in their senior SoftDev class. This is not to belittle the
Cornell Tech people but rather noting how advanced the work of the
Stuy kids is. Beyond that, I liked the composition of the groups I
talked to - nice combinations of skill sets and backgrounds. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I love the idea of the mentoring company which had an interesting effect on
the groups. In all cases, the mentoring company helped provide the
teams with an idea framework but in one case, I think the company's point of
view actually limited the groups vision a bit. This came up in our
discussions and I'm hoping that the students got something out of
that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also liked the crit review I was part of - bringing in outsiders to
show your work to and to get feedback from. It would probably hard
logistically at Stuy, but I'll talk to the guys there about the
concept. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I shared my contact info with the two groups that asked and if they
follow up, I'd love to be a resource for them. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm also looking forward to taking part in more events like this in
the future.

    <title>Halloween 2016</title>

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's Halloween and for the first time in 21 years, I'm not at work in costume.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It all began as a lark in October 1994:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-10-31-halloween/groo.jpg" rel="lightbox"&gt;
  &lt;img width="30%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-10-31-halloween/groo.jpg" class="" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And grew from there. A partial list of characters include:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groo the Wanderer,
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little Ceaser (Pizza Pizza)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jolly Green Giant
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homer Simpson (with my seniors as the rest of the cast)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duffman
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hans and Franz (with Boris)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hulk
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Blues Brothers (with JonAlf)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Evil (with JonAlf as Austin Powers)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While it was a lark, I noticed that days after, my students were
somewhat more relaxed and fun. If nothing else, it accelerated us
getting to know each other.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A likely turning point was when I was Bob Ross:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-10-31-halloween/bob_ross.jpg" rel="lightbox"&gt;
  &lt;img width="30%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-10-31-halloween/bob_ross.jpg" class="" alt=""&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-10-31-halloween/painting.jpg" rel="lightbox"&gt;
  &lt;img width="30%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/2013-10-31-halloween/painting.jpg" class="" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That was the first year that was just as performance based as it was costume based. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the downside is that pretty soon, I was expected to top
myself every year. The last couple of years were fun but part of me
felt like I was going through the motions. I needed a break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, now at Hunter College, I'm taking that break - no costume this
year. We'll see what the future holds, but here's a youtube playlist
with some of my favorite halloweens past.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Hunter CS is so important to NYC</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</id>
    <updated>2016-10-30T19:13:23-04:00</updated>

    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
&lt;a href="http://avc.com"&gt;avc.com&lt;/a&gt;, Today, &lt;a href="http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/"&gt;Fred's post&lt;/a&gt; talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We don't need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Return readers know that I've ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I've periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I've also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that &lt;a href="https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/"&gt;the emperor has no clothes&lt;/a&gt;, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some workforce programs like &lt;a href="https://perscholas.org/"&gt;Per Scholas&lt;/a&gt; that I really like
and respect but they're limited in what they can do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they'll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It's small
and has flown under the radar but it's one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I haven't written much about what's been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city's tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.

    <title>Using Emacs - 17 - misc small packages</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-17-misc/</id>
    <updated>2016-10-28T12:00:00-04:00</updated>

    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-17-misc/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm working on getting enough of my real configuration into this
series so that I can dump my current one and use this one all them
time and grow it back up an episode at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think we're almost there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This time, we're looking at a few small packages that I use all the
time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-1"&gt;Highlight line Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(global-hl-line-mode t)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
this turns on highlight line mode.  It makes it easy to see the line
the cursor's on. Nothing huge, I just like it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon"&gt;Beacon mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon"&gt;Beacon mode&lt;/a&gt; flashes the cursor whenever you scroll. It makes things
easy to locate the cursor when scrolling
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; flashes the cursor's line when you scroll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;beacon&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;beacon-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; this color looks good for the zenburn theme but not for the one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; I'm using for the videos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; (setq beacon-color "#666600")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete"&gt;Hungry Delete mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete"&gt;This mode&lt;/a&gt; deletes all the whitespace after the cursor (or before it)
when you use delete or backspace.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; deletes all the whitespace when you hit backspace or delete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;hungry-delete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global-hungry-delete-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el"&gt;Expand Region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/magnars"&gt;Magnar Sveen's&lt;/a&gt; awesome expand region mode is a must have. He also
wrote the amazing &lt;a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el"&gt;multiple cursors&lt;/a&gt; package. I highly recommend
checking out his work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Expand region expands the marked region by semantic units. It's my go
to way of marking text for manipulation
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; expand the marked region in semantic increments (negative prefix to reduce region)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;expand-region&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global-set-key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;kbd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"C-="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'er/expand-region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I also tried to look at aggressive indent but that had some problems
so we'll come back to that later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Knitting at a Tech Conference</title>

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/knitting-tech-conference/top.jpg" alt="top.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend was &lt;a href="http://catskillsconf.com"&gt;Catskills Conf&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite events of the
year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you know my wife, you know she's &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; knitting. Ok, not true,
she's always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form
of fiber craft.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can't complain. That's how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy
and Kandinsky sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks. It also
keeps her an my entire family in warm amazingly beautiful knit wear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While at the conference, Devorah was her usual self - knitting during
the talks. That doesn't mean she wasn't paying attention, it's just
what she does. We also noted a few other attendees knitting throughout
the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, this year, Devorah had an idea – let's focus those idle hands to
do some good. She asked the conference organizers to send out an email
to attendees - knit squares during the conference and Devorah will put
them together at the end and we'll donate the blanket we make to
children in need through &lt;a href="https://projectlinus.org/"&gt;Project Linus&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The organizers were supportive, if not somewhat skeptical. That was
ok - we also had no idea if this would be a win or a flop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Conference came and Devorah announced the project. She brought yarn,
needles, crochet hooks and instructions and also offered to teach
knitting during the breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It started slowly, but as the conference progressed, people started
knitting both during the talks and during the breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; leading knitting for children in need at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hn0rx633e1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hn0rx633e1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/789839861813575680"&gt;October 22, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Experienced knitters cranked out squares and newbies learned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jcn"&gt;@jcn&lt;/a&gt; knitting for charity with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash"&gt;#catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rvkSnMYDCp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rvkSnMYDCp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790164027494326272"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the conference, we collected the partials. Devorah's
going to finish the blanket up this week and then it gets donated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;6 X 5 and growing! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/epC9b3ap0t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epC9b3ap0t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devorah Zamansky (@DevorahZamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky/status/790697247965151232"&gt;October 24, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how much of a win was this? We got a blanket to donate to charity
and a couple of new knitters. We also heard and overheard some
interesting comments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One speaker commented that it as much better to see members of the
audience knitting for good rather than checking their cell phones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also overheard some attendees talking about how the knitting
project left them feeling more connected to the conference since they
were able to contribute something.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sounds like a pretty big win to me. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So much so that Devorah's thinking about taking the show on the road -
maybe other conferences would like their idle hands doing some good
while listening to talks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Waking up to a beautiful brisk morning at the Ashokan Center in the Hudson Valley.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year, Devorah and I attended the first &lt;a href="http://catskillsconf.com"&gt;Catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;, a tech
conference in Olivebridge, NY. It was an amazing and unique
experience. I can only describe it as Tech Conference meets Summer
camp. Where else can you hear talks by people like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dens?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"&gt;Dennis Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and
an alos hear the music of &lt;a href="http://www.mikeandruthy.com/"&gt;Mike and ruthy&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year, I gave another educaiton rant and to add to the fun,
Devorah's been leading a knitting for Charity project and teaching
attendees to knit:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Progress on the charity knitting project led by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash"&gt;#catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yoal7r48wO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yoal7r48wO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790155915307737088"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and we brought up my Hunter College students to join in the fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In spite of the fact that we were out late at the bonfiere:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ending a great day by relaxing next to the fire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LzKbftZamz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LzKbftZamz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christopher Short (@Shortoutloud) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shortoutloud/status/790020785943539712"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and then were kept up by the students bonding and chatting in the
bunkhouse, Devorah and I are first up, bright and early.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'll write up more about this amazing event some time over the
week. Right now, I think I'll just go out and enjoy a cup of coffee
and the clean brisk Hudson Valley air.

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those laptops that my Hunter students were supposed to get have
finally arrived. We're distributing them on Monday. Each student will
have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 for as long as they're in the
program. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This means we can finally start using the web as a way of displaying
and sharing our projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For this type of web development, I'm a big fan of using &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;. Flask
is a Python microframework. The easiest analogy is saying it's like
Ruby on rails but in Python. That's close enough for our purposes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I much prefer Python to Ruby as a teaching tool because it leads to
roads going in all sorts of directions so it was merely a matter of
figuring out which framework or platform to use. I found Django to be
far too big, cumbersome, and all encompasing while on the other hand,
&lt;a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/"&gt;Werkzeug&lt;/a&gt;, which Flask is based on is a little too low level.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Flask hit the sweet spot. Easy routing, session and form handling,
templates, pretty much everything I was looking for but very
unopinionated and open ended. Perfect for teaching and learning and
perfect for lightweight projects. The sourecode is also
straightforward enough for a student to explore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Below is a video going over setting up Linux from right after an
install to use the python virtualenv package. The next video will go
over installing Flask and setting up a simple application. Later, I'll
post a video on deployment to a &lt;a href="http://digitalocean.com"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; Droplet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are some notes relating to the video.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, go to your "software sources" or "software updates"
 application from the menu and select all the sources (as described n
 the video)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To update a new system:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To install the most recent emacs snapshot
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-add repository -y ppa:ubuntu-lisp
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To install python pip (used to install other python packages)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install python-pip
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and then to install the virtualenv packages
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo pip install virtualenv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To create a python3 virtual environment
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install -p python3 venv-folder
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can activate the envorinment (assuming you create the folder under
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
your home directory):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/venv-folder/bin/activate
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And to deactivate it, from the activated terminal
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;deactivate
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the video. Next time, we'll install Flask into an virtual
environment.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Emacs - 16 - Undo Tree</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-16-undo-tree/</id>
    <updated>2016-10-09T12:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <published>2016-10-09T12:00:00-04:00</published>
    <author>
      <name>Mike Zamansky</name>
    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-16-undo-tree/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you use emacs, you should keep an eye on Jon Snader's &lt;a href="http://irreal.org/blog/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://irreal.org/blog/"&gt;irreal.org&lt;/a&gt;. A few days he posted on &lt;a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5621"&gt;Undo Tree&lt;/a&gt; - a package that extends
Emacs's built in undo functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basic emacs has undo, bound to &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-/&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-_&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; but that's about
it. Undo tree, which you can set up with:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;undo-tree&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;:init&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global-undo-tree-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
adds two key features. First is redo, which you get by adding the
shift key to the undo keychords. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other, is the visual undo tree. You can bring that up wit &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-x
u&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once you bring up the undo tree, you can use the up and down arrows or
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-p&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to move between undo and redos. When you get to
what you want, just quit the undo tree visualizer with &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;q&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The cool part is that once you undo a few things and add new stuff,
you get a tree that you can navigate through using the arrows. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's much easier to get the flavor of this by watching the video
(which also has a lame example of using artist-mode which I'll come
back t at some point).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.

    <title>Chromebooks in K12</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/chromebooks/</id>
    <updated>2016-10-06T19:49:04-04:00</updated>
    <published>2016-10-06T19:49:04-04:00</published>
    <author>
      <name>Mike Zamansky</name>
    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/chromebooks/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
The discussion today over on &lt;a href="http://avc.com"&gt;AVC&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://avc.com/2016/10/chromebooks-in-k12/"&gt;Chromebooks in K12&lt;/a&gt;, a title I
conveniently lifted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the comments, I was asked my thoughts on chromebooks vs Linux on
low end hardware so, here they are.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Chromebooks are cheap, near instant on, and, if you're using Google
Apps for education, little to no administration necessary. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a HUGE win for schools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some issues. School WiFi, for example, is frequently
insufficient which can be a problem for a device that's meant to be
connected to the cloud. People might think that schools are well
connected but I know multiple schools that keep kids off the WiFi to
keep it from being overloaded. This is a problem and I don't know if
it's really being addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's also worth noting that DOE pricing is also a far cry from "lowest
bidder." We keep seeing sub $200 chromebooks on the market but buying
through the DOE approved vendor looks to cost about $300 per unit or
more. Of course this is better than the equally inflated PC/Mac
prices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Still, the price and easy of deployment and administration seem to
make chromebooks the way to go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to other issues, first, you have to buy in to the Google platform
– email, docs, classroom, etc. This isn't necessarily a problem. I
personally like most of Google's offerings. My big concern is giving
away student data. I have mixed feelings on the whole privacy thing
but it's more clear cut when it comes to minors in public schools -
schools shouldn't be sharing their data and schools shouldn't be
forcing them to share their data. Google Suite for Education is FERPA
compliant but what about all the other Google services the kids might
be using? I haven't looked at this carefully but we've already given
too much power to private interests over education (see the College
Board or Pearsons) so, at least to me, this is a concern.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My only other issue is a selfish one. As a CS educator, I look to
coding tools and environments. While there are online platforms like
cloud9 or &lt;a href="http://repl.it"&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt;, they don't have the same power and flexibility of
using local installs. I've been using repl.it and it's a great tool
but I think it's best used as a stepping stone to a local install and
then afterwards for some of it's specific value added features. I'm
also a big believer in teaching &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/shell/"&gt;operating system as tool box&lt;/a&gt;,
something you can't currently do with a chromebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willykaram"&gt;Willy Karam&lt;/a&gt; commented over at AVC about using cheap hardware running
Linux. This is something I've done for years and it's been a
lifesaver. CSTUY's entire laptop collection consists of really old
laptops running Linux. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For a CS class, this works well. Even for a non CS class it can work
well. Modern Linux distributions run pretty much the same as Windows
and MacOS. Use the mouse to click on menus and icons. It doesn't give
you the power of the command line but it means it's a suitable
alternative for the masses that use the operating system as a program loader..
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The downside of Linux for the general population is the administration
and maintenance. At Stuy, we set up NIS and NFS. Both horrible but
probably easier and better than most alternatives. I was never able to
come up with a better way to do authentication and file sharing and
the NFS stuff would have killed our wifi (we only used it in wired
labs). Customizing software installs is also a real problem. We made
it work but it took far too much time and effort.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you're in a situation where you can do a stock install and then
give the machine to the student for the semester, then Linux can work
really well. If you're talking about shared machines with custom
installs, it's harder to justify over chromebooks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A final note on chromebooks is that last year, I played with putting Linux on a
chromebook. It worked pretty well. Almost the best of both worlds. Low
end hardware with good battery life and a full operating system. This
is something I have to play with on the current generation of chromebooks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, where do I stand on this? The cloud isn't there yet in terms of
teaching computer science. It's fine for a gentle introduction but
eventually, you'll need the power of a full blown OS and local
installs. We may very well get to where a cloud OS is just as
expressive, we're just not there yet. On the other hand, for general
computing in schools, chromebooks are a big win.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It would be wonderful if schools had sufficient infrastructure,
support staff and training so that technology was just there and just
worked and we didn't have to make these sort of decisions and
compromises. Somehow I don't thing that will be happening any time soon.
&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
