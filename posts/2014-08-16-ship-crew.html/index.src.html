One of the most important, possibly the most important part of SHIP's
success was the crew and that's what sets us apart.
</p>

<p>
I've seen CS Ed organizations run by business people, lawyers,
investors and more.The people developing curriculum are EdTech people,
entrepreneurs and anything but seasoned educators. I've seen programs
developed, curriculum created and then the search for teachers
commence. Ofttimes real educators aren't involved at all.
</p>

<p>
We're teachers all the way down.
</p>

<p>
I've said it before and I'll say it again - it's not about the
curriculum, it's about the teachers. Take, for example, math. Math curricula
have been well defined for years but we still have major problems with
math education. The bottom line is that it's the teacher in the room
that can bring a topic to life or kill it. A great teacher can make
a lousy curriculum decent. A great curriculum won't do anything for a
lousy teacher.
</p>

<p>
That's where we will succeed - we've got the best teachers and
that's our crew.

I'm fortunate enough to have worked with some terrific teachers. If
they'd allow it, I'd like to think of three of them as my
proteges. Sam and JonAlf were actually students of mine when they were
at Stuy but I include Topher in the mix. Our fourth teacher, Yulia,
was JonAlf's student teacher this past year.
</p>

<p>
Coaching trees have become popular in recent history. It's kind of cool
that we have one for CS teachers.

<p>
Of course, it extends up as well, although my mentors, excepting Robert, didn't teach
CS.

<p>
And of course the rest of the team have other influences as well.
</p>

<p>
So let's talk about the crew.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-0-1">JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-1">
<p>
I like to describe JonAlf as a younger, hipper version of me. Of
course, I set the hip bar pretty low. I tell my kids that I used to be
the young teacher but I was never the hip teacher. 
</p>

<p>
JonAlf and I are probably the most similar in style. Of course, this
means that if you put us in a room together, all productivity
ceases. We've come up with such great ideas as our mascot, Clyde
"Thluffy" Sinclair," the Stuy CS semi-formal and more (or is that
less).
</p>

<p>
He's been my partner in crime since he came on board. Back in the day
I was the only teacher of our post AP classes and I was delighted to
offload some of that burden to JonAlf.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-0-2">Topher Brown</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-2">
<p>
JonAlf was the hip one (with the bar, admittedly set pretty low) until
Topher came aboard. Topher didn't go to Stuy so he can never be a made
man, but he's pretty awesome, nonetheless. He came in as a math
teacher who just coincidentally had a bit of a CS background. He fit
into our insanity from day one.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-0-3">Sam Konstantinovich</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-3">
<p>
Sam was also my student. He's the mature one (again, the bar was set
pretty low). I joke that he has the reputation for being the mean one
because his first day at Stuy he said something that scared some of
his students. Definitely more together and organized than the rest of
us I tried to convince him to join our team for three or four years
before he finally came over.
</p>

<p>
Just to be sure no one misreads my comments on Sam. I've trusted him
with my son's CS education. I think that should tell you how much I
think of him.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-0-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-0-4">Yulia Genkina</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-0-4">
<p>
Yulia's the new kid on the block. We all went in feeling very positive
about having her on the team. At least until she tried to off all of
us on Pirate Day.

Seriously though, she fits right in and is also a real talent.

That's the crew. I'm amazingly proud of all of them and one of the
things I was most happy about my role in SHIP was that I was able to
empower them to be themselves and just do their thing. When you have
a great crew that's how you do it.
