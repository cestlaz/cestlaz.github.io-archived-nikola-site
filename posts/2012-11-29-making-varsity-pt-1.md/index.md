I've never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say
this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we're
governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time
and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem
is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you're not in the top
"n," you're out. So, if our basketball team has, let's say 15 kids on
it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during
basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of
the team.

I coached Stuyvesant's fencing team for a bunch of years and I think I
did a pretty good job. We won our share of city titles but while most
coaches ran teams in a traditional way I never cut anyone -- we might
have over thirty people in a tiny room trying to learn how to fence.

I can be competitive and we often won but high school should be about
exposing kids to new experiences and the exclusiveness of competitive
sports seems to be contrary to this.

Thats why I love Stuy's rowing club. I've been involved in the program
for about five years now. Prior to that many of my CS students were
involved and they kept saying "Z - you've got to check out the rowing
club." During good weather, every Wednesday, we go up to <a
href="http://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/">the village community
boathouse</a> at Pier 40 and row <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_Rowboat">Whitehall
Gigs</a> - old school wooden boats - 4 oars and a coxswain. We've
rowed up to the Intrepid and down to the Statue of Liberty. 

It's a great activity and everyone's welcome. It's an athletic, team
building activity and very different from what our kids normally
do. It's an opportunity for our non-competitive kids to be involved in
a great athletic activity.

For our competitive kids, they can enter our races. Everyone can take
part in local races (cancelled this year due to Sandy) and we usually
send our top crew and a younger crew to events outside the city. Just
two weeks ago, Stuyvesant sent two crews up to Hull, MA to take part in
The Icebreaker Northeast Regional Youth Rowning Championships. Our
kids got to meet and compete with kids from all over the northeast.

If you're wondering about how we do with the non-cut format - both of
our boats won their respective divisions (first fours, the top
division, and second fours). A mixed crew with Stuy alumi won the
first sixes division. And yes, that's Batya in the picture - she coxed
our first fours.

It would be great if kids had more athletic opportunities like this.
