This past year, I was able to convince my administration to allow me
to create a new course - Software Development. I really felt there was
something missing in our kids CS preparation - missing both from
Stuy's program and from many youngsters college experiences.

I plan to do a few posts on the course, it's design, implementation,
and lessons learned, but for today, let's look at the years
culminating event:

The class had students working in teams taking projects from idea to
completion. Last week, we had a demo night, hosted by
[CSTUY](http://cstuy.org) and Google. Neal Zupancic, part of our Stuy
CS family attended the event and put together a wonderful write up on
the [CSTUY
Blog](http://cstuy.org/blog/stuy-cs-software-development-demo-night-neal-zupancic).

Before getting into details, thanks goes out to Ben Fried, Mike Mu,
and the rest of the Stuy CS Googlers who helped out. Ben for securing
the space, Mike for coordinating everything, and the rest for manning
the event.

The students, parents, friends, alums, and guests from the NY Tech scene gathered at Google at 6:00 last Thursday. Judging the event, we had 
[Brandon Diamond](https://twitter.com/brandondiamond) of HuffPost labs, founder of the [Hacker Union](http://www.hackerunion.org/) and [NYTM](http://nytm.org) board member, [Evan Korth](https://twitter.com/evankorth), founder of [hackNY](http://hackny.org), [NYTM](http://nytm.org) board member and NYU Professor and Lee Fischman, [StuyCS family](http://family.stuycs.org) member, currently at Galorath, and as dinosaurs like me remember, one of the creators of [The Big Electric Cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Electric_Cat). Awesome folk all.

The students presented a set of amazing projects. They can all be
found on the class [github page](http://github.com/stuycs-softdev).

The evening was like a NYTM for a group of amazing high school youngsters.

Here are some of the highlights:

The students had a great time and got lots of feedback from the
audience, particularly during pizza time after the demos.


I'll post more about the course in the coming weeks but demo night was
a terrific conclusion to a terrific first year.
