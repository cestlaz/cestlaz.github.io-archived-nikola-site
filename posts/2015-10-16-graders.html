		The other day codehs made an announcement about their new
		<a href="https://medium.com/codehs-product-updates/these-are-the-autograders-you-ve-been-looking-for-bda0fa8fd8a">autograder</a>. Fellow CS Teaching veteran Alfred Thompson had his say up
		on his <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/10/autogradersfor-good-or-for-evil.html">blog</a> where he talked about <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/">Mark Guzdial</a>'s comment on
		autograders leading to less creative assignments.
</p>

<p>
		I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend
		themselves to less creative projects, but thought I'd write up a few
		of my own thoughts on autograders.
</p>

<p>
		First and foremost, <b>I HATE GRADING</b>. It's one of the worst parts of
		my job and grading projects is <b>really</b> hard to do well.
</p>

<p>
		You'd think an autograder would be a panacea. 
</p>

<p>
		It's not. 
</p>

<p>
		In addition to them being very nit-picky &#x2013; got an extra space in your
		output? <b>FAIL</b>. Wrong number of significant digits? <b>FAIL</b>. Didn't
		handle all those "trick" cases? <b>FAIL</b>.
</p>

<p>
		Since autograders typically check your output against a correct
		solution, it's going to be limited in what it can grade right and
		wrong and what's more, it's very limited in the feedback it can give.
</p>

<p>
		These are some of the limitations that lead to less creative
		projects but that's not my beef with the autograders.
</p>

<p>
		Why do we give assignments? To assess students? Yes, but also to
		inform our instruction. We need to grade the assignments ourselves
		because those assignments tell us about our students and teach us how
		best to work with them. What's more, we really don't just want to see
		that finished product, but rather, we want to see the process as
		well. Autograders can't help here.
</p>

<p>
		I do use autograders &#x2013; <a href="http://codingbat.com/">codingbat.com</a> and our own locally developed
		<a href="http://bert.stuy.edu/pbrooks/SchemingBat/scheming.py">Scheming Bat.</a> I use them for small homeworks and class assignments
		early on. For bigger stuff, I do it myself.
</p>

<p>
		For advanced classes (AP and beyond) we're all about the GitHub. Not
		only can I grab the projects at any time but I can also see how
		projects were developed - logs, diffs, <a href="https://github.com/vynl/vynl-v0/graphs/contributors">graphs</a>. All give me insight
		into how the students working. Add in class lab time when I get to
		interact with the kids and I've got a good sense of my student
		computer scientists. 
</p>

<p>
		In our intro courses, where they're not ready for GitHub, we use
		Dropbox for sharing and collecting assignments. Not quite as good but
		we can still see a lot.
</p>

<p>
		At the end of the day, if a teacher doesn't look at a student's work
		directly, a teacher isn't going to know everything there is to know
		about a student. I can't imagine a top English teacher not reading a
		student's essays. We're no different. 
</p>

<p>
		It's time consuming and generally no fun but it's a big part of <b>real</b>
		education.
