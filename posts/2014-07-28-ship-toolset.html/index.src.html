We're almost at the end of CSTUY SHIP's first journey. The Shipmates
and stewards will be showing off their work in another day or so and
I'm excited to see their finished projects. 
</p>

<p>
But what toolset are they using.

With knew we would be working with two rooms of relative beginners. We
needed something that allowed us to develop the shipmates CS skills
while also having a low cost of entry. At the same time, we had to
use an environment that our Stewards would be comfortable with as they
would be both supporting the shipmates and developing their own projects.

Those of you that know me know that I'm <b><b>not</b></b> a fan of drag and drop
languages. I've looked at them time and again. I even made a concerted
effort while exploring a version of the new proposed AP course earlier
this year <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Languages such as scratch require almost no ramp up
but for kids that are old enough for a traditional text based language
I've found the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After a short time, my students find DnD languages restrictive and
slow. They can get more done more quickly by typing.
</li>
<li>Many kids work on laptops with small screens. Small screens and DnD
languages are not a good match.
</li>
<li>It's much easier to look things up in a text based language.
</li>
<li>I'm not convinced that starting with a DnD is in any way better
prepares a student for a text based language. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bottom line, I've had to rescue a number of kids who were turned off
by the "toy" factor of languages like scratch and appinventor.
</p>

<p>
DnD languages are probably fine for younger kids who are experimenting
and playing around but for my kids, I want something more real.

<b><b>Python</b></b> - I'm a big python fan. It's one of my go to languages. Low
  cost of entry and very flexible.

<b><b>Scheme</b></b> - I love functional. It's simple, but it's a harder sell
  for parents and while in school, it's ok to take a few days to ramp
  up to get to the fun stuff, in a summer program, a delay in fun can
  be deadly.

  the number of hidden problems for newbies.

<b><b>Java</b></b> - I'm not really a fan of the language but it is pretty
straightforward and it is the language of the AP exam. I'm not a fan
of AP but as we're trying to build a program from the ground up, it
doesn't hurt to be able to say "this will prepare you for APCS."

So what did we use? <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>. Processing is a wrapper and IDE around
Java. It's really simple to get started with and it makes all sorts of
graphics work very easy. Here's a simple processing program that
creates a circle wherever you click the mouse:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">setup</span>() {
  size(400,400);
}

<span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">mouseClicked</span>() {
    fill(color(random(255),random(255),random(255)));
    ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,20,20);
}

<span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">draw</span>() {

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That's it. No <b><b>public static void main&#x2026;</b></b> or anything like that, but
it's legit Java, has types and classes plus:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>great online documentation.
</li>
<li>it's used to interface with arduino.
</li>
<li>it has libraries for web cams, music, internet APIs, and more.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
By using something like processing, the shipmates learn a real
language with sufficient depth to do something real and there's also
enough of an online community so that they can continue to work on
their own if they can't avail themselves of our future programs.
</p>

<p>
While we were convinced that processing was the right choice for the
shipmates. I wasn't 100% sold on it as the best choice for the
stewards. Python would probably have been better for them but most of
them will be doing advanced Python (as well as Javascript) in their
classes in the fall and I didn't want to teach them something now and
reteach it to them in another month. On the other hand, they all
already knew Java and there was still plenty of neat things for them
to explore with processing. In the end, I think we made the right choice.

After going through the curriculum and scratch in depth, I
concluded that the intro course I designed and my team has evolved
over the past ten years is a stronger and more appropriate course for
our students.
