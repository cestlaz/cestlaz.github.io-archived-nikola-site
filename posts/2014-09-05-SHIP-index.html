I wanted to do a couple more posts on the <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a> summer program SHIP,
particularly about getting funding and reflections but I think I'll
just wrap things up with the school year starting. 
</p>

<p>
Overall it was an amazing success and I'm amazingly proud of the
entire team (in no particular order):
</p>

<p>
Devorah, JonAlf, Sam, Yulia, Topher, Ethan, 
Leslie, Brian, Andreas, Natan, Miranda, Nadia, Fawn, Lise, Jessica,
Angela, Benedict, Elise, Fish, and Derek.
</p>

<p>
and also proud of all the shipmates. Looking at where they started and
where they ended up &#x2013; they were really terrific.
</p>

<p>
The only downside is knowing what we can accomplish when we have the
freedom, it reminds me about how badly we're
handcuffed by our school and the department of education.
