One of the things I mentioned in my post on the [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-educators-stackexchange/][CS Educators
StackExchange]] was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My
friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate
as we're so young as a community. He's absolutely right but until we
mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources
and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and
discovering that they don't know about a site or a mailing list that
I've known about for years. Likewise, I'm appreciative when others
share resources with me.

There are some collections of information, for instance, [[https://twitter.com/alfredtwo][Alfred
Thompson]] has a list of CS Education bloggers but it's not so easy to
discover and it certainly shouldn't fall on Alfred to maintain such
a list making sure the links are all active and always being
responsible for adding new ones.
 
Recently I've noticed a proliferation of **awesome**
lists. These are community curated lists hosted up on GitHub for a
variety of projects. I find myself using [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs][awesome-emacs]] and
[[https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python][awesome-python]] more and more and there are tons of other such lists.

I thought we, as a community could benefit from such a list. 

I started one off. It's over at
[[https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education][https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education]] with instructions on
contributing at
[[https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org][https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org]].

I seeded it with a few items but I'd love everyone to get involved. I
also started it with a few categories and a specific format but I'd
love to see that evolve into something most useful for the community
as well.

If you agree that this could be something useful, please contribute to
it and help spread the word.
