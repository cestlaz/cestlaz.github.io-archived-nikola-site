Last year I [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/new-term-new-tool-replit][wrote about]] [[http://repl.it][repl.it]], an online IDE that supports multiple
languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and
since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I
used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a
lab where I couldn't easily install my own software. I'll continue to
use repl.it - mostly for it's ability to schedule publish and manage
assignments but when possible, I like having my students work
locally. 

This year I'm excited about another tool - [[http://thonny.org][Thonny]]. Thonny's a simple
Python IDE designed for beginners. I discovered it last year but at a
time when it was impractical for me to use with my students. This
year I can and I'm really liking it. I'm still an Emacs guy and will
continue to use Emacs for my python development ([[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-12-python/][video 1]], [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-13-yasnippet][video 2]]) but
for beginners I think Thonny is the way to go.

Some of Thonny's highlights:
- An integrated Python 3 virtual environment making for ease of
  installation and consistency across student installs
- A debugger that shows how expressions are evaluated
- Great visualizations of function calls that make it easier to
  understand the call stack and scope
- The ability to look at memory to understand references.

Rather than go into the gory details in text, I put together this
video:
