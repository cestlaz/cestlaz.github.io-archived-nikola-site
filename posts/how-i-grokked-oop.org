Time to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging.

Last week, in Garth Flint's post about his [[https://gflint.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/747/][summer plans]], Garth
mentioned wanting to get his head around Object Oriented Programming
and possibly taking a course to help him get there. I thought I'd talk
a little about how I got my head around OOP here and some of the
difficulties I faced then and what people might face now.

Nowadays, kids are faced with OOP pretty early on. If they take APCS-A
they're using Java which is Object Oriented. Same if they start
at a college using Java. If they start with C++ or Python they may or
may not see objects early on. In any event, the nature of that first
course doesn't really lend itself to really grokking OOP. Even if a
student takes a class prior to APCS-A or it's college equivalent,
they're pretty y raw. Small programs with just a few constructs don't
really show the uses of OOP. Both inheritance and interfaces can feel
forced in a first year course and when the examples are artificial and
wonky and their are easier ways to accomplish the same task, it's hard
for a student to really buy into the paradigm.

Now, in all fairness, I'm not a big fan of Object Oriented Programming
and it's usually not the first tool I go to. That said, it's a useful
tool and it has it's place.

I cut my teeth in the 1980s. I went to the Courant Institute at
NYU. The core language back then was Pascal which had a number of
limitations including only supporting single file programs. Somewhere
along the line I taught myself C which most professors were happy to
accept assignments in. I never heard of OOP in my formal
schooling. Some time near or soon after I graduated I had heard of
this C++ thing but hadn't used it.

After working my way through school I spent some time as a developer
at Goldman Sachs. I was the only guy on my team doing Windows 2.1
development. Windows 2.1 was built on top of DOS. It's big improvement
over Windows 1.0 was that it supported overlapping windows. Pretty cool.

I learned to program Windows like everyone else:

It was all done in C. The big project I was on was for Global
Equities. Specifically, supporting trading of Japanese Warrants. I had
to write a trading system and in doing that implement among other
things a mini spreadsheet in C from bare metal.

This was probably going to be the most complex thing I designed and
built from scratch to date. I had a bunch of cells that were
associated with either rows or columns or both and all sorts of
complex interactions. I needed a way to manage complexity and even
though I didn't use the term at the time, manage state. 

C doesn't have a lot of fancy in language constructs to help and I was
somewhat on an island - I taught myself C and there weren't any
experienced C / Windows programmers in my group or on my floor so I
had to figure things out on my own.

Here's what I came up with, or rather something like what I came up
with -- it was close to 30 years ago and I don't even remember 100% of
what it was supposed to do.

I decided to create a single file for each concept -

- cell.c / cell.h for cells
- row.c / row.h for rows
- sheet.c / sheet.h for 
- etc.

In each, I would do something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC c

/* sheet.c */


/* things declared here are "global" but limited to this file **/
struct sheet *sheets; /* an array of the sheets */

/* functions that will be made available to other files */

/* return a pointer to the named sheet */
struct sheet sheet_get(char *name){
/* implementation */
}

/* create a new sheet */
struct sheet *sheet_create(char *name, int rows, int cols){
/* implementation/
}

/* functions that will only be used internally */

struct sheet *allocate_sheet_memory(int rows, int cols){
/*implementation*/
}


/* etc */
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC c
  /* sheet.h */

  /* 
     Note that only the headers for the exterrnally available stuff is included
  ,*/


  struct sheet *sheet_get(char *name);
  struct sheet *sheet_create(char *name,int rows, int cols);


#+END_SRC

The idea is that everything about a sheet is in ~sheet.c~ and only a
few functions are made available to the rest of the program via the
header file. 

Shortly after I designed the program, I started to delve into OOP at
the encouragement of some colleagues. I read Meyer:

and the first edition of Booch:

I realized that in a way I was implementing singleton objects in
C. The file declared the object. The functions I exposed via the
header files were public, the other functions private and the "global"
variables that were local to the file, private class variables.

There was no inheritance but it did help me encapsulate functionality
and state. 

It turns out I saw something like this when I briefly looked at Ada. I
think it was called Object Typed Programming - objects with only a
single instance and no inheritance. 

The books gave me the official names for things but the project I was
developing gave me the context to where it all made sense. I had a
problem to solve that didn't lend itself to a low level imperative
language but you work with the tools you have and this is what I came
up with.

Unfortunately, it's harder for beginners as projects are smaller and
while there are good small example of OOP there's also so much going
on in a course like APCS-A. It gets more convoluted when you're using
Python or C++ as you might be shown Objects in a C++ class while
professor is really teaching C with Objects rather than doing things
the C++ way. 

One thing that helps is using a language or tool where objects make
sense. NetLogo - used in Stuy's intro course is a nice one. Turtles
and patches - the inhabitants of the NetLogo can be viewed as
objects. I'd draw heavily on NetLogo analogies when teaching APCS at
Stuy. There are also tools like BlueJ which is tied closely to objects
and is probably terrific at giving structure to help objects make
sense but I don't like those types of tools for other reasons.

At the end of the day, it is just a tool and to be honest, I'm not
really a big fan of OOP. I'll use it but it's not my go to paradigm.

I'll leave you with this video which talks about why:
