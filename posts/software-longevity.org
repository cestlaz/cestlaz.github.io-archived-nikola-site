Writing about [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/rite-of-passage-projects/#.W3l-fxhKhhE][old projects]] got me thinking of my first programming gig
and software longevity. It was a part time after school / full time
summer job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown. I started in my senior year in high
school and continued through most of my first year in college. It
wasn't my first job - that was being a delivery boy at [[http://videoroom.net/][Video Room]], an
independent video store that's survived from the old VHS/Betamax days
through DVDs and is still, somehow or other, surviving in this day and
age of streaming video. My job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown was my first job
as a programmer. I got it through my buddy Ben who got it from one of
our math teachers at Stuy. Ben had found a job closer to home so
passed this one along to me.

Arcus-Simplex-Brown was (is?) a ticket printing company

They also did tickets for sporting events like the Knicks and
Rangers at the Garden. More recently, this was 1983, they had started
selling computer printed tickets and that's where I came in. They had
a dot matrix line printer. Not the small kind used by personal
computer owners and small businesses:

Printers like the [[https://global.epson.com/company/corporate_history/milestone_products/11_mx80.html][Epson MX 80]] pictured above had a print head that
moved across a line at a time much like a modern desktop ink jet
printer. The difference was that it had a print head that had a matrix
of pins which fired and hit an ink ribbon which left the ink
impression on the paper.

Rather, they had a big heavy duty one where the print head went across
the entire width of the paper and it literally printed a line at a
time

and a computer attached. I think it was an old [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Star_Computers][North Star]]
computer. It ran [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M][CP/M]] which was like a primitive version of
MS-DOS. 64K of memory  and
two floppy drives. It had a basic interpreter built in and they
also had a basic compiler. 

They had a program that was supposed to print the tickets but it
didn't really work. My first job was to get it working, It was a HUGE
mess of a program. God knows how many lines of BASIC code with a few
gosubs and a ton of gotos. I don't think there were too many
comments. It didn't help that in addition to having to deal with
custom theater seating plans and ticket policies you had to know all
sorts of magical incantations to get the printer to do the special
fonts correctly and I don't recall us having a printer manual so it
all had to be divined from the non-working code. 

On top of all this, the program was so complex that only the simplest
test cases could be run via the interpreter interactively. Any real
change had to go through the compiler and it took about 40 minutes to
compile the program. Whenever I wanted to take a long break, I set up
a compile. 

Somehow or other, I got the thing to work. The code started as a mess
and I didn't improve it any I really had no idea what I was
doing. Still, it did work and we were able to reliably print tickets
for all sorts of things.

I stopped working at Arcus-Simplex-Brown once I got a job at NYU. That
gig ultimately turned into a full time job which enabled me to work my
way through school. It was the right move but I had a great time and
learned a lot at Arcus.

I didn't think much about the work I did at Arcus over the years. I
finished college, went to Goldman, then some consulting and ultimately
 teaching career.

One day at Stuy, I noticed this:

This was now Spring 2012 - almost 30 years later. Judging from the dot
pattern  of the letters it looked like the same printer and was
probably the same program!!!!!!! I couldn't believe it. Stuy didn't
use these tickets back in my day so I was really surprised. It looked
like some horrible code I wrote as a kid was still being used
productively almost three decades later!!!!!! They could have
continued to use it because it basically worked or maybe because they
were afraid that touching it would break everything.


I don't remember what the code looked like but know it was
horrible. If I had it, I'd be to embarrassed to share and that's saying
something. 

The lesson of all this? You never know how long your code is going to
live. It might surprise you. Hopefully in a good way. 

All the more reason to do better than I did and learn how to do it
right.
