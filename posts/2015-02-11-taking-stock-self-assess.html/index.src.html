<p>
When starting the spring semester, students are frequently a little
rusty. They just had a high intensity month of study, tests, and
projects. That was followed by a week of nothing.
</p>

<p>
I like to start with something lightweight that gets them coding again
and ramps them up to speed.
</p>

<p>
In SoftDev I started with a brief overview of the HTML5 canvas and
then gave them a small homework assignment to do something fun.
</p>

<p>
I also remind the kids to self assess where they are and how they've
developed as a programmer. 
</p>

<p>
I get a little tired of education "experts" espousing nonsense like you
have to have each talk each day or that you need to assess each kid
multiple times a period. That's nonsense. With 34 kids in a 40 minute
class and 150 kids a day, that doesn't fly. Besides, so many concepts
take time to develop, learn, and absorb. 
</p>

<p>
Yes, you can get some instant and short term feedback but a lot more
is revealed over time.
</p>

<p>
I'm attaching a small sampling of their homework assignments. It was
basically a one day assignment to do something fun with the HTML5
canvas and indeed, it looks like they had fun.
</p>

<p>
I asked the kids to reflect on what they did now and what they could
do a semester, two, and three semesters ago.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning they would have had no idea how to approach any of
these. A year ago, they would be a major project. Now, they can knock
these out as a homework assignment. 
</p>

<p>
Once you take a step back to look at how much a student can grow in a
year or so you have to marvel at the results.
</p>

<p>
At a place like Stuy, the kids frequently and unfairly judge themselves against
super prodigies. 
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping by looking back at what they could do then vs now they'll
appreciate how awesome they are.
