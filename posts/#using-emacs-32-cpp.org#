This video is specifically for my students or any students out there
who are starting with C++ and emacs. The videos also longer than usual, coming in
at a little over 20 minutes.

The big difference is instead of building on my [[https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs][existing config]], the
code at the bottom is a complete standalone configuration. It's all
pulled from the main config with one additional package.

By taking the code at the bottom and putting in into a file named **init.el** in a
directory off of your home directory named **.emacs.d** and run emacs,
it will install everything and you'll be good to go.

If you've been following this series, the only new package is [[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags][ggtags]]
and the configuration code is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; tags for code navigation
  (use-package ggtags
    :ensure t
    :config 
    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
	      (lambda ()
		(when (derived-mode-p 'c-mode 'c++-mode 'java-mode)
		  (ggtags-mode 1))))
    )
#+END_SRC

For people new to the series, the top section sets up the emacs
package manager. After that we install:

| Package       | Description                           |
|---------------+---------------------------------------|
| which-key     | brings up contextual key binding help |
| auto-complete | just as the name says                 |
| flycheck      | in line, live syntax checking         |
| yasnippet     | snippets and expansion                |
| ggtags        | source code navigation                |
| color-theme   |                                       |
| moe-theme     | just because                       |

The video also show me using **counsel-ag** which is part of the
swiper/counsel package. You can check that out [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-6-swiper][here]] as well as some
other packages I use like **smartparens**, **hungry-delete** and
probably a few more.

You can look at my complete configuration or the other videos for
details.

If you're an experienced C++ developer and use emacs, please share
tips, tricks, and suggestions. I haven't done serious C++ work in over
a decade and while I did professional development in C in a past life,
never in C++.

The packages used here are not C++ specific - I use them for Java,
Python, Clojure, and Javascript development as well.


Here's the configuration code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  ;; set up package sources
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
	       '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)

  ;; Bootstrap `use-package'
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  ;; small interface tweaks
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'revert-buffer)

  ;; bring up help for key bindings
  (use-package which-key
    :ensure t 
    :config
    (which-key-mode))


  ;; Auto completion
  (use-package auto-complete
    :ensure t
    :init
    (progn
      (ac-config-default)
      (global-auto-complete-mode t)
      ))


  ;; on the fly syntax checking
  (use-package flycheck
    :ensure t
    :init
    (global-flycheck-mode t))

  ;; snippets and snippet expansion
  (use-package yasnippet
    :ensure t
    :init
    (yas-global-mode 1))


  ;; tags for code navigation
  (use-package ggtags
    :ensure t
    :config 
    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
	      (lambda ()
		(when (derived-mode-p 'c-mode 'c++-mode 'java-mode)
		  (ggtags-mode 1))))
    )


  ;; Theme
  (use-package color-theme
    :ensure t)
  (use-package moe-theme
    :ensure t)
  (moe-light)
