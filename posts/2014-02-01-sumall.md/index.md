Our hackers have been coming down to [SumAll](http://sumall.com) every
Saturday for a while now. It's a great space and we've been given run
of the office. That said, the hackers really had no idea what SumAll
is all about.

Today, we had our first guest speaker. Davin Chew, founder and CTO of
SumAll. Davin's also a member of the StuyCS family, he was my student back in the nineties. When Davin heard
we needed space for our Saturday program, he and the SumAll team
graciously offered to host.

Davin spoke to the hackers about what SumAll does, how it's trying to, in Davin's words "Democratize data." How they're building a platform that lets a small business or even an individual really study their data. They've got some great visualizations and tools and you all should [check them out](http://sumall.com) (and yes, according to their web site, there is and always will be a free tier).

Davin talked a little about how he and his co-founder sat in the room
we were all in and how they came up with SumAll. He talked about
passions, starting out a new compnay and a variety of other topics.

It's always great to connect young hackers with people doing great
work in the real world so they can get a glimpse of the awesome things
they will be able to accomplish in the coming years.
