I'm guessing my views  on this aren't very popular -that's OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.

A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren't careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we're well on our way down
that road.

I've ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE][STEM Oil Salesmen]] [fn::Not my term, but I really like it]
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.

I've also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE][Superficial PD and scripted curricula]]  and my concern that   
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE][we'll be done]].

I've been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it's wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I'm seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.

The other week I noticed, [[http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we][this post]] by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by [[http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our][this one]] which also highlights actually taking the exam.

This didn't sit well with me. 

What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn't drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE][assessments]]. The college credit thing? I'm
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I'm still skeptical
here. Placement? It's a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?

Reasons not to take the exam?
 
- If it doesn't do anything for the kid, why take it
- Stress of taking the exam
- There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college
- Save the expense

As a general rule, I'm against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we've been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I've
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all **fail** AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he's moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.

This follows last year's announcement that code.org was [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE][partnering with
the College Board]] - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light [fn::If you think that PD based
teacher training is OK, ask yourself if you want your own child's
chemistry teacher to be a history teacher with a few weeks summer
training in chemistry] as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value[fn::And I'm guessing the exam will be offered
during the day so teachers will proctor for free rather than be
allowed to, you know, teach their students.].

Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn't do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.

True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It's
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.

I don't doubt code.org's sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I'm
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we'll regret years from now.
