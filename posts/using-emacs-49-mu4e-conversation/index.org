I've been using Emacs for email for a couple of years now. Not for
everything, for now my personal email is still Gmail but work is sent
and read through Emacs. I'm currently using [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] and while it has a
few quirks and limitations, I like it very much. You can take a look
on how I configure and use it [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-39-mu4e/][here]].

The other day I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8qryri/mu4econversation_single_buffer_fullthread_display/][this]] thread on Emacs about a new package -
[[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/mu4e-conversation][mu4e-conversation]]. It's a package that deals with email threads.

It's pretty cool. You can invoke it whenever you're in the headers
view you can just run ~M-x mu4e-conversation~ and it combines all the
email messages in the current thread into a single buffer. 

It's pretty nice. 

You can navigate between messages in the thread with ~C-c C-n~ and
~C-c C-p~ and use most if not all of the usual mu4e goodness but on
top of that you can also toggle what the author calls tree mode by
hitting ~V~. Tree mode turns the thread into an org-mode tree - also
extremely cool.

On top of this, you can also make mu4e your default viewing mode by
setting a single variable with ~(setq mu4e-view-func 'mu4e-conversation)~.


Although it's very cool, I'm not sure if mu4e-conversation will find
its way into my workflow or not and probably won't know for a
while. This is mostly due to the fact that it's summer so work email
slows down and I won't have too many long threads to play with this
on.

I'll report back once I give it a fair shake but in the meantime if
anyone out there has had the time to play with it, let us know what
you think.
