I've been having fun with this years [[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] competition. So
far, I've been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in
another couple of days since I'll be traveling for the weekend.

After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other
solutions on the Advent of Code [[https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/][subreddit]]. Even with similar
agorithmic solutions there's a decent amount of variation in the
actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically
different.

That got me thinking about how the tools we know and use both shape the ways we
approach solving problems and creating things and either limit or
empower us to go from a mental model of a solution or creation to an
actual artifact. 

Relating to this are the common themes that come up in the CS
Education world. The idea that it's computer science not programming
and certainly not merely coding. That's true but the tools and
languages we use shape the whole thinking part and can also give the
students a valuable practical tool that they can leverage to great
advantage in both future classes and work and life endeavors.

I decided to do this rant as a video. I hope you enjoy it:
