Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.
</p>

<p>
We're busy organizing <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY's</a> first <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks">hackathon</a>. It's going to be at
<a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a>, where we hold our weekly <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions">hacking sessions</a> but while taking
registration, we had a little program.
</p>

<p>
The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story &#x2013; when
people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts,
many don't show. I asked all of the applicants to confirm by filling
out a second Google doc.
</p>

<p>
Then it got to reminder time - I wanted to send an email out to all
those kids who signed up on the first form, but hadn't confirmed on
the second. 
</p>

<p>
Two Google spreadsheets with an email field. I needed all the people
on sheet 1 that weren't on sheet 2. I'm sure there's some
spreadsheet-fu that accomplishes this, but nothing I know. I also
could have written a little python script which isn't so bad, but this
was a perfect time to turn to the shell.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how a command line guy would do this.
</p>

<p>
To start, I put the emails in two files: e1 and e2. The first has
all the original applicants, the second those that confirmed.
