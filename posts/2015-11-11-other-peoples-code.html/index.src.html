The coding on their project is reminiscent in many ways of an Ed
Sheerhan song. It left me in tears and very confused as to what the
author was trying to accomplish.

We had some fun last week. Well, OK, I had some fun. The SoftDev
classes had just finished a little project. Basically, a blogging
platform. Something that would tie together all the tools we've been
using. Flask, user management, an SQL database (SQLite), and a nice
looking front end. 
</p>

<p>
It was also the first real group project so the teams have started to
learn how to work together. 
</p>

<p>
After some project demos, it was time for part two: NOSQL. We explored
MongoDB and then it was time for the project - clean up the
previous project through the use of techniques like template
inheritance and convert the database backend to MongoDB.
</p>

<p>
The catch? Each group would take another groups project and use that
as their starter code. The rules? They could modify and refactor but
they couldn't rewrite.
</p>

<p>
It threw the groups for a loop but I ultimately think they had
fun with this.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards each group gave a write up to their starter group. What
made their life easier, what made it harder. We then circled up for
discussion as a class.
</p>

<p>
It was terrific.
</p>

<p>
First, it was great that we've gotten to a point where everyone feels
comfortable giving each other constructive criticism. We've gotten to
the point where the class is a team.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, I'm hoping that everyone got a lot out of the exercise.
</p>

<p>
As each group talked, common themes arose:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>consistent commenting is good</li>
<li>variable names matter</li>
<li>unused code and files can be misleading</li>
<li>overall code structure, file names, and locations are important.</li>
<li>and much more</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're now going to start a discussion of coding style, standards, and
documentation.
</p>

<p>
I've got to say that I'm very happy how this little experiment worked
out.
