One of my titles at Hunter College is Director of the Daedalus CS
Honors program. It's something like a Hunter specific, CS specific
version of the CUNY Macaulay Honors program. 

Hunter gives all its students the ability to get a great computer
science education at a fraction of the cost of a private institution
and if you're a Daedalus scholar you also get a scholarship, a laptop,
special classes (with me :-) ), activities and more. Just the other
day we visited  [[http://samsungnext.com/][Samsung Next]] accelerator and earlier in the year we
made our annual visit to [[http://www.catskillsconf.com/][Catskills Conf]], arguably my favorite event of
the year. 

When deciding on which students to recommend for acceptance, I try to
glean as much information as I can about each applicant. When I feel
there's not enough information, I've been known to reach out to
recommenders and other sources for more. But first I go through the
applications. For each student, I'm provided with a pdf file with a
bunch of data and also an entry in an internal Hunter online form with
even more.

For the first cohort, this wasn't a big deal. I hadn't even started at
Hunter when the applications closed so there was no
outreach. Everything was after the fact so there were very few
students to evaluate.

Last year, I was able to do some outreach and we had around 60 or so
applications for a little over 20 spots.

This year, there are well over 100 applicants (and we're looking to
grow the program by a large number of students). All of a sudden, it
wasn't so easy to navigate all the pdf files.

Emacs to the rescue. Using a combination of org-mod,  [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]], and
[[https://melpa.org/#/org-pdfview][org-pdfview]] I've come up with a workflow that I very much like.

Take a look and let me know what you think:
