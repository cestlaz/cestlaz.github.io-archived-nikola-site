If I'm doing my job right, by the time my kids graduate they can learn
on their own.
</p>

<p>
It's like when two years ago, before starting her summer internship,
Batya listed all the tools and technologies she had to work with. When
I pointed out that she hadn't ever used any of them before and asked
how she was going to deal with it, she replied "I'll figure it out."
And she did. 
</p>

<p>
At the end of the summer, Dina told a similar story about her
internship and how she knew she'd figure everything out because of the
solid background she got by going through StuyCS. 
</p>

<p>
I loved both these stories.
</p>

<p>
But getting the kids there takes time.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, in my AP classes, I assigned three <i>codingbat</i> problems. I
decided to go objects first this time round so we haven't done any
language constructs. The problems were simple String manipulations but
I added one that needed conditionals.
</p>

<p>
Today we went over them. Most of the class solved the assignment and
most had either no trouble or had to do just a little work.
</p>

<p>
I asked what about that last problem might have caused some
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
They couldn't figure it out, it seemed pretty straighforward. After a
number of guesses, one student  said:
</p>

<p>
"Wait, we don't know ifs"
</p>

<p>
That was it. They didn't realize that they had taught themselves
something new.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, doesn't just happen.
</p>

<p>
They've seen conditionals in all sorts of guises.
</p>

<p>
Scheme:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> boolean_expression
  True_part
  False_part)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
NetLogo:
</p>
<pre class="example">
if boolean [True part]

and

ifelse boolean [True part][ False part]
</pre>

<p>
and Python:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> <span style="color: #483d8b;">bool</span>:
  s1
<span style="color: #a020f0;">elif</span> bool2:
  s2
<span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span>:
  s3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and so on.
</p>

<p>
So they new the concept, from there it was just details.
</p>

<p>
Some said they just wrote it and it worked. Some said they looked up
sample code. Most didn't think they were doing anything new.
</p>

<p>
It was pretty awesome.
</p>

<p>
It's still a long road before they graduate, but we're getting there.
