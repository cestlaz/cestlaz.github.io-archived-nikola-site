Once again, it's time for [[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] - a series of small
programming problems released once a day. 

I wrote a bit about it [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-15-advent.html/][last]] [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/#.WEMqBB9ieYQ][year]] and you can still find last years
problems [[http://adventofcode.com/2015/][here]].

It's only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice
for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I'm thinking of
looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.

I didn't think about this much last year but one thing I really like
about the competition is that each problem comes in two parts. You're
first presented with the problem and the input and once you put in the
correct answer, you're presented with part two.

This can be annoying at times, particularly when it requires a large
code rewrite but it also means that well designed, not too specific
solutions are rewarded. 

It's not quite the same as changing the specs on a project mid way but
it does encourage thinking about more than just solving a super
specific problem.

Check out [[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] and see if it's something you or your classes
might enjoy.
