People sometimes accuse me of being an elitist CS snob that I feel that CS
teachers have to have advanced CS degrees. 

It's not that at all. Rather, I feel that CS teachers are smart and
capable. Circumstances frequently result in a teacher in front of a CS
class with limited content and pedagogical content knowledge. It's not
ideal but it's reality. Of course I feel that we should do everything
to support and encourage these teachers but we should also insist that
after a reasonable period of time, they know their stuff.

This is why I hate it when I hear people in the CS Ed community say
something is too hard. Git's too hard. The command line is too
hard. Functional programming's too hard [fn::whether or not any of
these topics are appropriate for a particular course is discussion for
another time]. That's all nonsense. At last
year's SIGCSE conference people from a state, I forget which, was
considering not using the Praxis exam for CS teacher certification
even though the state uses the Praxis exam for other subject
areas. They claimed that the praxis was too hard for CS teachers.

I haven't taken the Praxis exam but some friends have. It doesn't
appear to be unreasonable at all[fn::although I'm not a big believer
in standardized exams for certification or in general.].

While I can certainly understand a teacher not knowing much when they
start - thrown in due to necessity I think it's ridiculous not to
insist that they ultimately get to real mastery.

A math teacher generally has to know math beyond calculus. Science
teachers have to have gotten through Orgo. English teachers have to
understand Joyce. **THIS IS HARD STUFF!!!!**[fn::There are plenty of
lousy teacher prep programs that don't ensure teachers learn the
subject matter they should but the good ones do.]

I think it's insulting to say that CS teachers aren't capable of doing
the same in their subject area.
