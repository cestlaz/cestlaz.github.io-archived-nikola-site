We'll get back to CS content soon, but for now:
</p>

<p>
Last Tuesday was Election day - no students in the school - a day
devoted to professional development. Traditionally, math team coaches
from around the city descend on Stuy for a day full of lectures,
discussion, and general catching up. I've never actually attended
these meetings. In the past, they were for math team coaches only and this
year, I was actually allowed to do something with the CS teachers.
</p>

<p>
These meetings used to be organized by my late friend and colleague,
Rich Geller so it made sense that we took time at end of the day to
honor his memory and unveil a memorial dedicated to Rich and his
work. Rich was a legendary Stuy teacher, but more on that shortly.
</p>

<p>
As I looked at Rich's memorial, I couldn't help and turn my head
around to gaze at another memorial - "Celebration" - created to honor
the memory of another legendary teacher that died before his time -
Richard Rothenberg.
</p>

<p>
Both of these men were friends and mentors. I thought I'd dedicate
this post to some of the things I learned from both of them.
</p>

<p>
Richard Rothenberg, known to me as Richie or Doc was the math chair
when I was a senior. He taught AP Computer Science that year and he
hired me back a few years later.
</p>

<p>
He didn't give me my first teaching gig. He knew that I had to go
somewhere else to develop my chops. We did stay in touch, though, and
he hired me two and a half years later.
</p>

<p>
Doc was an amazing teacher but he was also someone who worked 
tirelessly behind the scenes for the good of his students.
</p>

<p>
I remember one year he heard that one our recent graduates got into
some trouble at college. Doc got wind of this and went out of his way
to contact the college on the student's behalf. The student never
knew. That was Doc.
</p>

<p>
He also understood the "big picture."
</p>

<p>
I was at a parents association meeting early in my Stuy career. All of
the assistant principals were taking turns talking to an audience of
Freshman parents.
</p>

<p>
Each got up  and started to brag about their program:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We had n intel semi finalists last year
</li>
<li>Our kids won whatever essay writing contest
</li>
<li>Six kids won gold medals in&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each AP was bragging about how awesome their department was but in
truth they were talking about a handful of excellent kids who would
have excelled no matter where they went. I'd guess Stuy or at least
Stuy's educational programs probably had very little to do with these
top kid's development and in any event, this wasn't really relevant to
parents of incoming students.
</p>

<p>
Then it was Richie's turn.
</p>

<p>
Richie got up and said the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Go home, hug your children, ask them how their days were.
Encourage them and support them.
Everything else will work itself out.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That really stayed with me. So few teachers look beyond their field. I
remember talking to one of the best chemistry teachers I know - I
asked "what do you do knowing that most of your kids won't be and in
fact shouldn't be chemists?" The reply was that he looked at all his
students as though they all wanted to be and were going to be
chemists. Doc looked at his students as whole people first -
mathematicians second. That's one of the many lessons I learned from Doc.

<p>
Richard Geller was never my teacher. He was my colleague and friend.
</p>

<p>
He introduced me to fine dining and wine. We talked food, biking, and
teaching.
</p>

<p>
Rich had a reputation for being unyielding and strict. Many students
went into his class in fear but just as many came back after
graduating to thank him.
</p>

<p>
I remember one of our mutual students saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I need to be in Mr. Geller's once every three terms to keep me in good
habits. Then I need a couple of pushover teachers in between to pump
up my GPA.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He was a top math teacher but his students learned much
more. Responsibility, respect, having care and pride in one's work,
and more.
</p>

<p>
Rich was a demanding teacher and one who really cared about his
students. When grads came back from college and Rich would great them
with a smile. The scary teacher was gone. He asked how and what the
graduates were doing and he honestly cared. Gone was the in class
persona. That was business. 
</p>

<p>
In some ways Rich was much like an earlier Stuyvesant math
legend. Phil Fisher, who terrorized us poor calc students in the
'80s. I got to know Phil when I came back as a teacher and once he
explained why he was so rigid and strict in class. Phil explained that
here he was, charged with teaching these amazing talented Stuy
students while at the same time, he felt he wasn't nearly as smart as
them. Phil needed 100% focus during every minute of every class to
give the kids what they deserved. 
</p>

<p>
I think Rich was something like that. Not exactly the same, he also
wanted the kids to learn to be responsible and respectful but I think
the core idea was the same.
</p>

<p>
As a colleague and friend, Rich was the first guy to show appreciation
and the guy with enough character to tell you not what you wanted to
hear but what you needed to hear. I also learned to always be open and
honest with my team. Make sure everyone had all the information.

<p>
I learned a lot from both of these men. Stuyvesant misses them and I
miss them, but the there influence lives on through me, their
students, colleagues and friends.
