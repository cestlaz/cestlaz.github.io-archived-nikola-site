Earlier in the term, our intro classes spent a little time learning
some basic HTML. We don't spend a lot of time on it, just enough so
that the students can present their work in a static web site. The end
goal, though, was to programatically generate the web sites - there's
nothing quite as empowering to a student as when they can present their
work to the world.

Finally, it's all coming together.

Now that the classes are comfortable with Python, we can have some
fun. We all remember Mad Libs - that wacky word game where you select
unknowingly select words to substitute into a basic story and
hilarity ensues.


We did our own versions using Python files, lists and
dictionaries. 

Here are some of the results:

The students wrote a basic story with substitution points. Their
programs then randomly replaced these points with words from an
assortment of categorized lists. 

Enjoy!!!!!
