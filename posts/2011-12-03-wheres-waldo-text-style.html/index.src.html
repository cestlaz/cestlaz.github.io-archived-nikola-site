Over the years, I've tried different things when teaching 2 dimensional arrays. Simple game boards, representing a crossword puzzle, tables of various sorts, etc.<br /><br />This year,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jonalf.com/">JonAlf</a>, one of my amazingly talented colleagues,&nbsp;decided to go with building a word search. I decided to steal the idea. It's a great one.<br /><br />I thought I'd use this post to go through the project and why I like it.<br /><br />Ultimately, the students end up with a program that will generate an n by m&nbsp;word search filled with random words from a dictionary. We gave the kids a skeleton of the base class. The only actual code we had to supply was the method that loaded a dictionary file into memory. You can check out the assignment <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/stuycs.org/home/courses/ml1x/zamansky/work/hw-20-duetbd">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the finished code&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ml1x-z-src/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2FWordSearch">here</a>&nbsp;(we updated the repository as the project developed).<br /><br /><br />The first part of the project are pretty mundane. The kids write a couple of constructors and toString. Basically just practice traversing a 2D array. The project starts to get interesting at part 2, when they write the methods that add words into the grid. First horizontally:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1428475.js?file=addWordH"></script><br /><br />After they write the method to add words vertically, we can start to refine things. We notice that the routines are essentially the same. The only difference between adding a word horizontally and vertically is &nbsp;what we add &nbsp;to the row and column each time. For one, there is a delta column of + 1, for the other it's a delta row. Further, they realize that adding diagonal words just needs both deltas. This leads us to factoring out the common aspects of the code and writing something like:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1428495.js"></script><br /><br />All of a sudden, they've written one piece of code that can add words in 8 orientations.<br /><br />After filling the rest of the grid with random letters, we turn our attention to building a random puzzle.<br /><br />This part of the project involves using an ArrayList of words. Our students frequently mix up array and ArrayList notation early on so by having a project that uses both but in clearly delineated areas, the students can be more comfortable with each.<br /><br />For this piece, the code is again straight forward. Students run a loop that gets a random word from our dictionary and tries to place it in our grid at a random location choosing one of our possible orientations randomly. We get to see another nice little refinement again when we move from the typical first take at building a random puzzle which uses a three (or more) way if statement to select how to add words:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1428594.js?file=addWords1"></script><br /><br />to using our more general addWords method described above:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1428599.js?file=addWords2"></script><br /><br /><br />When we're all done, we had some time to project the word search on the board and fun was had by all.<br /><br />Peter, another one of our CS teachers had a great suggestion that I think I'll try. Start a competition to have the students modify the program so that it generates as densely packed &nbsp;a wordsearch &nbsp;as possible (giving higher scores first for longer words, then number of words).<br /><br />Between the way the project broke down, the topics covered and the little refinements, I really enjoyed working with my classes on this project -- I'm hoping they enjoyed it as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-2041316883816388484?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
