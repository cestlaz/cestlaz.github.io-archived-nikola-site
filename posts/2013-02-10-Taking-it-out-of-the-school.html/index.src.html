Inspired by the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/JonSimantov">Jon
Simantov</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davidblerner">David
Lerner</a> as well as the greater Stuy CS family, a few of us have
been working on <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>, Computer Science
and Technology for Urban Youth. Yeah, we backed into the
acronym. Let's bring Stuy CS out of Stuy so we can work on inspiring
a wider range of students.
<p>
Well, last Wednesday we had our inaugural event. Hosted
by <a href="http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/nyc/">NY
TechStars</a> (thanks Moisey), we invited 75 youngsters to an evening
of talks. The idea was to have five different speakers each deliver
words of wisdom and inspiration on a different but related topic.
<p>

First up, John Lee of <a href="http://schoolyourself.org/index.html">School Yourself</a>.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>

John talked about big data. Starting with a question "Who plays Chase
on House?" John showed that by looking at huge data sets we can,
relatively easily, come up with the answer. John showed that problems
such as question answering are really accessible to youngsters. They
might just be beginning, but they're not far away from being able to
do some really cool things.
<p>

Next up <a href="https://twitter.com/moiseyuretsky">Moisey Uretsky</a>. Moisey talked about his journey from
graduating high school through his college days, to starting
companies, successes, failures and the adventure along the way. Moisey was frank and engaging and really gave the kids a lot to think about.
<p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/spikegronim">Spike Gronim</a> was next. 
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>

Also talking about big data but Spike talked more about the dangers of
misinterpreting data and how different representations can yield very
different results. Spike also spent time giving career advice.

<a href="https://twitter.com/TimNovikoff">Tim Novikoff</a> gave a different perspective. Tim spoke about how his explorations in IOS development lead in a roundabout way to his doctoral studies and very interesting research.

<p>
<p>

Hitting cleanup was Gerry Seidman of <a href="http://www.tactonic.com/company.html">Tactonic Technologies</a>. 
<p>
<p>

Gerry gave a whirlwind talk about many of the things he's worked
on. As he said "I don't have time to talk about anything, so I'll talk
about everything." Highlights included the latest touch technology he's
working on as well as vacation man++.
<p>

<p>
<p>

While each talk was different, there were common themes:
<p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Do something you're passionate about.</li>
<li>Build stuff and do stuff.</li>
<li>Journey can begin in unexpected ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>

It was a great first event. We're very excited about <a
href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a> and are looking to roll out more
programs including more talks, classes, mentoring, internships and
more. We're also planning professional development opportunities for
computer science teachers.

<p>
<p>

We'll be putting some of the attendees' takes on the event up on the
CSTUY <a href="http://cstuy.org/blog">blog</a> over the next few days.
