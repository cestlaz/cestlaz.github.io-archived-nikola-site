<p>
I won't be teaching my regular classes tomorrow. I'll be
meeting all my kids but classes will only be 12 minutes long.
</p>

<p>
So, how will my colleagues and I spend the rest of the day?
</p>

<p>
<b>Proctoring the PSAT.</b>
</p>

<p>
This has always been a sore point with me. Back in the day, many
schools, Stuy included, offered the PSAT on the weekend. If you wanted
to proctor, you'd come in and get paid a little extra. As a kid, if
you wanted to take the exam you'd come in as well.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember when it changed but at some point it did. The DOE
decreed that if you offered the PSAT during the week on school time,
the DOE would pay for the exams. This was done under the ridiculous
idea that all kids taking a test that counts for nothing is a good
thing. You can make a claim that having taken the PSAT gives the kids
some familiarity with the SAT but the SAT's value as a predictor of
college success is questionable at best anyway.
</p>

<p>
Of course, setting things up like this is a great deal for the College
Board. It looks like they get a $15 per kid cash cow every year from
the NYC tax payers. It's a hidden expense so no one complains but we
keep shoveling the money out the door.
</p>

<p>
What's worse is that we also provide the College Board with free
labor - rather then spend my day teaching my kids I'm working for free
for the College Board administering their test to my kids.
</p>

<p>
Teachers do the work, kids suffer through the exam, and the College
Board laughs all the way to the bank.
