It's been a while since my last post.
</p>

<p>
That's mostly since I've getting things ready for this announcement.
</p>

<p>
I've talked about our non-profit <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a> before. Well, we've been hard
at work getting things together for our first summer program:
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">SHIP - Summer Hackers Immersion Program</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
We're really excited about this - taking our years of experience
teaching kids at our schools and taking it to a wider audience.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>SHIP</b></b> is being hosted at St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn and runs from July 7th through July 31.
</p>

<p>
So, if you know a rising 9th through 12th grader in or around New York City let them know about this great opportuity.
