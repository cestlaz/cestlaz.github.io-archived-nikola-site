About a month ago, I talked about using [real
data](http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/04/14/Real_Data.html#.UZjTjqDctKk)
with our intro classes. After looking at the correlation between
school's SAT scores and free and reduced lunch rates, it was time to
turn the students loose.

The assignment: Find some interesting data out and do something with
it. Make a web page that shows what you did and what you
discoverde. We had already looked at the NYC Data Mine as well as a
few other sources but students were encouraged to find new data sourcess.

The results were terrific. On top of the requirements, some students
figured out how to incorporate Google Maps, graphs, and other niceties
well beyond what we've covered in class.
