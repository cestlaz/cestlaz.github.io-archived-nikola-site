Has everyone seen <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>?
</p>

<p>
It's a site with a series of programming problems that are being
revealed one a day, a la an advent calendar. You can read more about
it <a href="http://adventofcode.com/about">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I came to the party a little late so I'm only up to day 6.
</p>

<p>
Each problem comes in two parts. The second is revealed after you
complete the first. Both students and teachers are enjoying the
problems.
</p>

<p>
What I like about the Advent of code, besides the one a day release,
is the fact that at least so far, the problems aren't super crazy
hard. They require a little thought but they seem very doable.
</p>

<p>
For me, that makes them a perfect platform on which to play with a new
language. I'm working through these in Clojure. I've been putting my
solutions up <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/adventofcodeclojure">here</a>. I have no idea if my code is "good" Clojure but
it's been fun nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
So, if you're looking for a nice set of small programming problems
and want to explore something new, check it out.
