I've been meaning to get back to making Emacs videos but I've been
having trouble figuring out what to record.

People have asked for [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] but I only use the basics and I think
there are already some great videos on it out there. I'd also like to
get more comfortable with DIRED mode and then do a video on it but I'm
not there yet. I've also been looking into packages that manage
workspaces like Eyebrowse and Persp-mode but neither are really doing
it for my workflow.

This morning I saw an post on the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7249jt/introducing_treemacs_a_modern_file_project/][Emacs subreddit]] about [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#treemacs---a-tree-layout-file-explorer-for-emacs][Treemacs]] - a
sidebar file browser similar to what the Atom editor has. It's pretty
slick. I particularly like the integration with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]. 

I suspect I won't integrate a file browser side bar into my workflow -
I've probably spent too many years with Emacs built in buffer commands
but if like that type of interface, definitely check Treemacs out.
