<p>
Almost twenty six years. That's how long I've been a NYC public school
teacher. Most of that time at my alma mater, Stuyvesant. 
</p>

<p>
A couple of years ago, the school paper wrote up an overview of my
career. I re-posted it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/09/17/stuycs-spectator.html#.Vnqfxh8Sr0o">here</a>. I'm somtimes amazed at where we are now
and how we got here.
</p>

<p>
Regulars here also know my frustrations. To Stuy, I'm an
interchangeable, generic math teacher and the DOE has shown no
interested in supporting what we've built. I've also written about my
concerns with the direction the city's going with respect to K12 CS
education.
</p>

<p>
It was time for me to start the next phase of my career.
</p>

<p>
I'm happy to say that I will be joining Hunter College in late
		January. I'll be developing their CS Teacher Ed program and also
		working with their computer science undergrads. I'll also have the
		opportunity to work with the Manhattan/Hunter Science High School and
		Hunter College High School.
</p>

<p>
		I also look forward to the opportunity to work more closely with my
		friends in the K12 Ed space.
</p>

<p>
		I'm very excited about this opportunity but it feels a bit weird after
		being in the same place for so long. I don't feel any special
		attachment to the institution that is Stuyvesant, my allegiance is to
		my current and former students and that community isn't going
		anywhere. Next year I'll still be working with terrific young people,
		just in a different location under a different name.
</p>

<p>
		I will miss the team that we've put together but even then, we get to
		continue our work with CSTUY.
</p>

<p>
		With the new year comes new opportunity and I can't wait.
