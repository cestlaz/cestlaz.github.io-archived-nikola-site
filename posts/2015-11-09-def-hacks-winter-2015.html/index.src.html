Last March, we (CSTUY) hosted our first hackathon - def hacks():
</p>

<p>
It was a tremendous success. Fifty students of all experience levels,
a bunch of great mentors and judges - added all together and it was a
terrific day.
</p>

<p>
I wrote about it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/29/defhacks.html#.VkFAN5_0-Ak">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
We're doing it again. We love last years hosts <a href="http://sumall.com/">SumAll</a> and are grateful
that they continue to host our Saturday <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions">Hacking Sessions</a> but we are
also grateful to Facebook NY for allowing us to use their larger space for
this edition of def hacks(). Larger space = more hackers.
</p>

<p>
So, if you're a high school student who wants to spend a fun day
building something cool or if you know one, more information and
registration can be found here:
