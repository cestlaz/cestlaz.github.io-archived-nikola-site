A week or so ago I wrote about the event we had to kick off 
[[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-tech-kickoff][Hunter College's partnering with the NY tech community]] to build a
Hunter to tech pipeline. Each table had two Hunter students and a
group of tech professionals. Each table discussed the Hunter CS
experience and how the tech community can help support the
students. Towards the end of the event a colleague commented that it
was a great idea to have the students essentially run the tables and
how effective it was. I didn't see any other way to do it. 

You have to trust the students. Put them in situations where they can
grow.

In addition to the event being a success overall, I think that for the
students it helped to break down barriers. These kids are soon to be
joining the tech community. They'll be interviewing for
internships and then jobs and the whole process can be rather
intimidating. By the end of the event the other week, there weren't
tables of students and professionals but rather tables of people all
having discussions on equal footing. It seems like a small thing. A
minor choice on how to run an event but it can have a subtle but
substantial impact in ways that are hard to see unless you look.

I was also reminded of this when reading Alfred Thompson's post on 
[[http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/11/how-some-schools-sabotage-computer.html][school tech management teams and CS teachers]]. Alfred wrote about the
possible tension between the needs of CS teachers and the needs of the
rest of the school and the obligations of the people that actually set
up and maintain the technology in a school.

Years ago, at Stuy, I skirted the issue by taking on the
obligation of maintaining my own labs. This let me run Linux and
basically do whatever I felt we needed. It also meant my labs wouldn't
be set up for things like standardized testing. This came at a
price. I had to maintain it all myself. This is not to say that the
tech people haven't helped over the years. Some of them have been
terrific but other than swapping out bad machines it all fell on me.

Of course this wouldn't have been possible if it really all fell to
me. It only worked because I was able to enlist the aid of students
who wanted to learn about building and running a Linux network. Sure I
showed them some things but largely we [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-31-devops.html][figured it out
together]]. Basically I trusted the kids with access and control and
gave them a safe place to learn and explore. 

It worked amazingly well. 

Of course there were plenty of headaches. There was the time when we
only had one AI/X server for the school and Jon somehow erased all the
shared libraries or the time when I think Paul or Ilya took away read
and execute access from all the system executables. I lost plenty of
sleep and pulled out much hair recovering from these messes and others
but I couldn't get too upset. They were learning, no one got hurt, and
truthfully they never committed any blunders worse than my own.

Giving up control to the kids can be nerve wracking at times but it's
worth it. It's why I always found coaching more stressful than
competing back when I fenced. You can do everything to prepare your
athletes but when they're out on the strip, there's nothing you can do
to help. It's all on them. On the other hand, I've always been more
gratified with my athletes or students successes than with my
own. There's something special about enabling others.

This is not to say that we just turn our students loose.  We have to
set our students up to succeed. Set up the environment and the
circumstance and give the students the tools to work with. At the
event two weeks ago I knew that everyone in the room was a friend or
when I have students plan a hackathon and have them cold call a
company, maybe the company expects the call. There are all sorts of
things we can do behind the scenes to set out students up for success.

We set the stage and if we do it right, the kids won't
fail to impress.
