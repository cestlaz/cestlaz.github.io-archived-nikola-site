Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education. 

Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.

Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.

Long time blogger [[https://twitter.com/davewiner][Dave Winer]] put together [[http://trumpstatus.org/][trumpstatus.org]] where he's
collecting many of the issues that we're all so alarmed with.

I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I've been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.


My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It's not quite as bad as:

First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is **NOT** the time for business as
usual.

With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations. 

Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers. 

With Friday's order, the whole tech community came out.

Here's part of a thread by tech activist [[https://twitter.com/anildash][Anil Dash]] calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.

We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.

If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women's
rights and on and on.

This means we all have to get involved and stay involved. 

What have I been doing?

- I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.
- I subscribed to [[https://dailyaction.org][Daily Action]] so that I get a reminder each day of
  someone I can call to make a difference.
- I'm starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I
  make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
  remind our representatives who they work for.
- Education and advocacy


And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.

Thus ends my not business as usual post. What's going on in America is
not someone else's problem - it's all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.
