Spreadsheets are terrific - we've all used them. I particularly like
Google spreadsheets - I use them all the time to collect data, usually
from students. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to Google Drive
</li>
<li>Make a form 
</li>
<li>Send the form out to the students
</li>
<li>Wait
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All the data gets dumped into a Google spreadsheet. The trouble is,
what to do with it once it's in the spreadsheet. 
</p>

<p>
The other day, I wrote on a few basic stats for our upcoming SHIP
program. The data I reported on was all collected in a spreadsheet. I
also collected participant and parent emails in the spreadsheet. 
</p>

<p>
So, here's the task, compute some simple numbers form the spreadsheet
and also extract and use the email addresses.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure one could use some fancy spreadsheet magic to get the job
done, but I'm a command line wonk &#x2013; here's how I take care of tasks
like these.
</p>

<p>
First, I downloaded the spreadsheet as a csv (comma separated value)
file. Each line looked something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-csv">last,first,email,address,gender,grade,school,...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
First question, how many applicants did we have:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">cat cstuy.csv | wc -l
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which gave:
</p>
<pre class="example">
47
</pre>



<p>
The |, or pipe means take the output of the first command and send it
to the  next one. <b>Cat</b> just outputs the original file and <b>wc -l</b> counts all
the lines in the file.
</p>

<p>
Next, how many young ladies:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">cat cstuy.csv | grep female | wc -l
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The results: 
</p>
<pre class="example">
17
</pre>

<p>
How many schools? Well, that's a little trickier. Here, I use a few
extra commands:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cut - this will cut out one column from the csv file - in this case
the school column (the -d, says use a comma as delimiter and -f7 for
field 7).
</li>
<li>sort - takes the lines and sorts them.
</li>
<li>uniq - eliminates duplicate lines in a sorted file
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Putting it all together:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">cat cstuy.csv | cut -d, -f7 | sort | uniq | wc -l
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Results: 
</p>
<pre class="example">
30
</pre>


<p>
Thirty different schools.
</p>

<p>
Finally I needed the emails - here I wanted to be able to paste them
into Gmail's bcc field. I could have just used <b>cat</b> and <b>cut</b> and
then used the mouse, but instead:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">cat cstuy.csv | cut -d, -f3 | xclip -sel clip
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then I can just do a Ctrl-v in Gmail and I'm good to go.
</p>

<p>
The cool thing is that the tools here - cut, sort, uniq, grep  - are
all general purpose tools that do simple text manipulations. Once you
know them and a few others, you can really quickly and efficiently do
all sorts of data processing without even thinking about it. I still
go to the spreadsheet for data collection ad also for when I need more
hardcore formulas but for day to day manipulations, I'll take the
command line.
