The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion
today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving
technical problems during an interview was going to follow him
throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.
</p>

<p>
An interesting discussion followed.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a
large tech company. A couple of younger engineers were with us along
with a new hire. The youngsters started talking about the new hires
technical interview questions. One older engineer light heartedly
asked another "I don't recall any tricky technical questions, how
about you?" "I don't recall any either&#x2026;" and on around the table.
</p>

<p>
Of course these senior engineers had track records that stretched for
miles.
</p>

<p>
I never liked those tech interview questions. If you just took
algorithms, you've got an edge and it really seems to be more of a
test of "have you seen this problem before" rather than a true test of
ability.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer those few companies that give "take home assignments" or
use other ways to determine fit.
</p>

<p>
The tech interview reminds me of the pop quiz or a poorly designed
test. If you just ask the question that the kid doesn't get, the kid's
in trouble. A kid could know how to handle 90% of the work but if the
question is that last 10%, zero credit. 
</p>

<p>
As teachers, we end up using many forms of assessment and try to
develop an overall picture of a student.
</p>

<p>
Companies should try to do the same.
</p>

<p>
Why to companies still use these technical interview questions?
</p>

<p>
Quite simply because they can.
</p>

<p>
A company might miss out on a number of great candidates by using a
bad technical question but they will probably get at least a
reasonably strong hire that passes the test. For the company, mission
accomplished.
</p>

<p>
As teachers, we can't do that. I'm not given a class of 32 kids and
asked to pull out a couple of software engineers. As teachers, we're
supposed to pull everyone along.
