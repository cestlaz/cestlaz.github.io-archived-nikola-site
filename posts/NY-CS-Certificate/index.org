Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.

I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.

Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science 
#+END_QUOTE

No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we'll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.

I haven't had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:

- As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a
  teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.
- There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /
  Masters degree
- There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the
  workforce
- There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they
  won't have to give up tenure in their current license.
- There will be an "individual evaluation" pathway which sounds to me
  like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.
- There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2012
- There's a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.

This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.

Of course, the devil is in the details. What's an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.

As I said, I haven't had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.

Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a [[http://www.uft.org/][UFT]] representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from [[https://www.nysut.org/][NYSUT]] was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I've already written on how I feel that this is a [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry][red
herring]]. What shocked me though was their feeling that "we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They're doing a great job and don't need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge." I think they're wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that's needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.

In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I'll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.
