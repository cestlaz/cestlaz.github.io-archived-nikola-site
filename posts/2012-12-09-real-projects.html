This post was supposed to be about varsity academic teams but I wanted
to share something else first.

<p>
For years I was unhappy with our "research" course but due to the
misguided views of our past administration, I pretty much had to keep
it running. Over the same time, I was frustrated by the fact that
there was so much missing in our students computer science related
education. Specifically, kids don't really get to experience creating
large "real" systems from beginning to end. I was also frustrated by
the fact that the previous administration prevented me from creating a
course to address this problem.


<p>
Due to a particular set of circumstances, I was able to
convert our research course into what is now my "Software Development"
course.

<p>
So far, I'm very happy with the results.

<p>
The classes just finished their latest projects. Over the course of
about three week, mostly on their own time, working around homework
and other obligations, student groups designed, developed, tested and
deployed a range of applications. 

<p>
All the programs
use <a href="flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> as a web framework. Many
use <a href="mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> to store data and they used a
range of web resources and apis. The students were a little limited by
the time frame of the project and the fact that I just started
teaching them how to use javascript mid project, but they really did a
terrific job.

<p>
A few in particular were a lot of fun:

<p>
<div align="center">

</a>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:7207">Survival Guide</a> used
Google Maps to help prepare you for all sorts of disasters ranging
from Hurricanes, to Alien Invasions, to the Zombie Apocalypse.

<p>
A <a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:6202">Movie recommender</a> That used
MoveDB, YouTube, and the NY Times API to find and show info about
movies and actors.

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:7203">
<img width="400px" src="/img/recipe-pricer.png"/>
</a>
</div>
<p>
<a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:7203">Recipe Pricer</a> scrapes <a href="http://allrecipes.com">allrecipes.com</a> for a
recipe then uses Google's shopping API to price out the ingredients
(with some interesting results).

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:7205">
<img width="400px" src="/img/stuy-page.png"/>
</a>
</div>
<p>
One group remade the <a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:7205">Stuyvesant
Home Page</a> but since they're using a Twilio test account you won't
be able to see the really neat stuff they did.

<p>
and

<p>
<a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:6206">Tweet Stat</a> tells you how well
your favorite celebrity spells.

<p>
This is just a sampling.

<p>
You can see all of them at <a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org/project2-results.html">Our Projects Page</a> and all the code is up on GitHub (linked from the page).

<p>
I'd encourage you to take a look. It would be terrific if you could
give the class feedback either by commenting here or on the project
page.

<p>
I can't wait to see what they do for their next projects.

<p>
Special thanks to Ben, Moisey and the entire <a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> team for providing us with server space for all of this.
