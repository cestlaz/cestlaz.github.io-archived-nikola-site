One of my favorite but little used emacs features is rectangular
editing. It's little used because I don't need it all that often. It's
one of my favorites because when I do need it, it's just so amazingly
useful.

The idea is you can mark a rectangle of text, cut it and later paste
it.  This means that if you have three columns of text:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a b c
d e f
g h i
j k l
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can easily mark the middle column (b e h k) or even just the b e
and h, cut it and paste it elsewhere as a rectangle. You can also open
up a rectangular region (filled with whitespace). There are a couple
of other niceties but that's the basic idea.

Here's a link to all the functions:

And the video:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML

#+END_EXPORT

Enjoy.
