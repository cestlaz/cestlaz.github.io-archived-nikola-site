Saw this tweet the other day so I though I would try to plug the
[[https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education][Awesome CS Education]] list I started on GitHub:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csteachers?src=hash">#csteachers</a>...didn&#39;t I see a list of CS teacher blogs here recently?</p>&mdash; Pam Whitlock (@PamWhitlock1) <a href="https://twitter.com/PamWhitlock1/status/910662628757864448">September 21, 2017</a></blockquote>

To answer the tweet, the closet thing I know to a list is [[https://twitter.com/alfredtwo][Alfred
Thompson]]'s blog roll which is actually a post he wrote on his blog
in 2012. Unfortunately his list can be hard to find and is somewhat
out of date. 

The idea of an "awesome" list is publicly hosting a simple site that
is community driven and anyone can suggest additions and edits. 

I put up a starter [[https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education][here]] and a few people have contributed but I'd love
to get more people involved. Awesome lists have a number of advantages
over other repositories.

- Unlike blog posts, the site is easy to find.
- Unlike private mailing lists or Facebook, anyone can see the content.
- Anyone can suggest additions (although you need to create a Github
  account).
- Anyone can download or fork the site.
- It's essentially plain text and is easy to edit (just read the
  [[https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org][contribution guide]]).

So, there you have it. If you have a blog or resource to share please
submit a pull request. Over time this could be a terrific single
starting point for educators to get to a wealth of resources.
