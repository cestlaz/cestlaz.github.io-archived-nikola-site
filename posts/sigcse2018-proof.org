Next up from SIGCSE2018 is [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159609][Connect the Dots to Prove It]] presented by
Mark McCartin-Lim. This paper was presented during the same papers
session as [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-theory][MacCormick]] paper I wrote up previously and my reaction to
this one was similar to my reaction to MacCormick's.

My reaction to MacCormick was - "This is awesome but while he's talking
about redesigning existing theory courses, I think we can get a lot of
mileage out of bringing these ideas into lower level CS courses."

I felt similarly about this paper.

The premise is simple - proof is hard and teaching proof is
hard. Students don't know how to begin, what's allowed, what's not
allowed, what's sufficient etc. McCartin-Lim and his team developed a
software tool to present proof as a puzzle and to provide students
with necessary support. 

The tool allows students to interactively construct a graph of their
proof. The graph helps students visualize the proof and the
relationships between the assumptions and assertions.

Here's an example:


#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center

And a more complex one:


#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
[[../../img/sigcse2018-proof2.png]]

My immediate thought was that this should be reskinned as a high
school product and rolled out in Geometry classes. I've written before
about the fact that proof is [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for/][rarely taught]] and rarely taught well even
though it's supposed to be the star topic between Algebra and Trigonometry. A tool like this could
probably help. This made me think further of the disconnect between
K12 and higher education. McCartin-Lim talked about students having
difficulty learning proof but lost in the conversation is that
students should start building there proof related foundations in high
school and supporting them in those early years can go a long way to
alleviate problems that only surface at the college level.
