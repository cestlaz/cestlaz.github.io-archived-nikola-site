		I'm moving to a new blogging platform. I'm still going to use GitHub
		pages but after a few years of using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, I'm switching to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.
</p>

<p>
		I think I've got the move worked out but if you're reading this via an
		rss or atom reader, make sure to check back in a couple of days - you
		might have to re-subscribe.
</p>

<p>
		Why am I switching?
</p>

<p>
		Because I hate Ruby. 
</p>

<p>
		Ok, not really - I barely know the language. I was already a  Python
		guy when Ruby came along and I didn't see any real added value to
		switching. 
</p>

<p>
		This isn't really about Ruby though, it's really about how that which
		we don't know is strange and frightening. In this case, the ruby ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
		I started using Jekyll because that's what was supported by GitHub
		pages. It's fairly simple and it basically worked. It had a few
		warts, specifically, I've had problems getting org-mode blog posts to
		publish just the way I'd like and it's hard to debug when a post has
		some bad markup in it, but it got the job done. 
</p>

<p>
		Recently, though, I've had to re-install Jekyll a number of  times and
		for me, that's been a nightmare.
</p>

<p>
		One is supposed to just be able to <b><b>sudo gem install jekyll</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
		Ok, so you need some packages installed:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
</pre></div>

<p>
		But I've got ruby 1.9 and I need ruby 2 point something. Ok:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev
</pre></div>

<p>
		But that fails since we're still running 1.9. Every time I look for a
		solution I go down the ruby ecosystem rabbit hole. 
</p>

<p>
		All I want is Jekyll!!!!!!
</p>

<p>
		Why can't I just <b><b>pip install jekyll</b></b> like I can do with Python
		packages!!!!!
</p>

<p>
		In truth, there's nothing wrong with the ruby ecosystem, It's just
		something I'm not familiar with. I probably had to go through the same
		battles with Python it's just that I did them incrementally over time.
</p>

<p>
		The truth is, setting up a development environment should be much
		easier. It used to be that I installed Linux, it had C installed and I
		just had to install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>. Now it's all about tool chains, virtual
		environments, containers, and more.
</p>

<p>
		I think this is what <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat">Roy</a> was talking about when we traded
		tweets on using development environments in an  <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2016/04/12/ide-or-cloud.html#.Vw_nPN9vETt">Ide or in the cloud</a>.
</p>

<p>
		If it's hard for me to get an environment running, imagine some poor
		soul who just went through a "learn to code" web site and now has to
		figure out how to set up his or her own machine!!!!!!
</p>

<p>
		I don't have a solution but at least it hasn't stopped me and others
		from trying new things.
</p>

<p>
		Two of my CS blogging friends, <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/">Garth Flint</a> and <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/">Alfred Thompson</a> have in
		their own ways talked about this same issue. Garth, showing a bias
		towards VB yet still working to get his head around Python. Alfred
		shows the same disdain for Linux and the command line as I show
		towards Windows. All this leads to valuable learning experiences and
		discussions.
</p>

<p>
		Personally, I'm also going through this battle as I continue to
		explore Clojure.
</p>

<p>
		So, I'm going to finish the changeover to Nikola in the next day or
		two. Remember to check back in case the feeds aren't working.
</p>

<p>
		Once I make the change, I'll talk about Jekyll vs Nikola as actual
		blogging platforms.
