I spent the last couple of days attending [[http://go.personaldemocracy.com/][Personal Democracy Forum
2016]], described on their landing site as:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The world’s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology's
impact on politics, government, and society.
#+END_QUOTE

That's the reason why I haven't posted my latest Emacs video.

PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important
issues. I'll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks. 

One topic that I've already lamented about has been the way we as a
society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms
like Facebook.

I use Facebook as much as the next guy but it always irks me when I
see a CS Education post followed by rich discussion hidden within
Facebook's walls and not available for discovery to the outside world
and the future.

I generally don't get a lot of comments on my posts, but when I do,
more appear in the Facebook link to my post rather than publicly on
the post itself.

At the conference, we watched a video by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan][Hossein Derakhshan]] which
talked about the direction the web is moving in and the red flags it
should raise with all of us. He echoed my concerns and beyond but in a much more
eloquent way.

I'm urging you to take the less than ten minutes to watch this
video. I know school's winding down for all of us but for those of you
who are teachers out there - share this with your students. I'm sure a
rich discussion will follow.
