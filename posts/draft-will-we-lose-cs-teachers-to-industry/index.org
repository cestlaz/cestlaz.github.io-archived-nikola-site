If we properly prepare CS teachers, won't they just jump ship and take
tech industry jobs?
#+END_QUOTE

I hear that a lot.

Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and
have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.

Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher
"training" - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge,
even less real content knowledge. That  will keep them in the classroom.

They're wrong.

People fearing an exodus of prepared CS teachers don't get
education. True, many young CS teachers will leave the profession but
that's because many young teachers leave the profession. Why do young
teachers leave? Regardless of subject area some of the reasons are:

- It's much harder than everyone thinks it is
- Low pay
- Lack of respect
- Overworked
- Lack of autonomy
- Being scapegoated for poverty
- It's become about testing, not teaching

None of these are unique to computer science teachers so the argument
that CS teachers who know too much will leave is really saying, "we
have to keep our teachers dumb enough to stay - make sure they don't
have outside options" rather than "let's make teaching a desirable
profession to be in."  

Of course, this is bred from a lack of understanding about what drives
teachers. It's typical of politicians and business leaders and short
term temps like TFAers who came in for a cup of coffee and now know
how to solve the education problem.

Teachers don't become teachers to get rich or to do better than the
other guy -- I know I didn't. We enter it to do good - to uplift the
have nots. This is why business models like stack ranking and bonus or
merit pay just don't work. A school is a team and we're all in it
together. Our job is to take care of our kids, not to be better than
that other guy. We wish we had more time to work together and to
improve things for our entire population.

Back to computer science.

My contention is that you might lose some teachers to industry but
they either weren't meant to be teachers anyway or they couldn't
afford to be teachers or the system beat them down. None of these are
reasons not to properly prepare them.

We can also look to the past to allay concerns. While it's true that
for hiring purposes, English teachers are a dime a dozen and typically
have fewer outside options (although great English teachers are harder
to find), Math and Science teachers generally have had options. I know
many top Math and Science teachers who could easily get non teaching
jobs - the Math teachers in finance the science, certainly in
pharmaceutical companies over in NJ. These options exist yet we manage
to populate our classes with teachers. True, it's difficult at times,
particularly in Physics, but these are due to the lack of respect
teaching gets as a profession.

If we prepare CS teachers properly, yes, we'll lose some, but we'll
keep the ones we're supposed to or if we lose them it will be due to
other factors. Additionally, by having proper CS teacher
preparation programs, we'll also provide an entry path to those people
meant to be teachers but prior had no way of getting in.

As a nation, we're moving away from prepared, knowledgeable teachers
and towards drill-masters. Let's not let CS Education go the same
way.
