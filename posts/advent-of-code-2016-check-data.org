I'm spending the weekend up in Michigan. Visiting my brother and is
family. We're here to see the [[http://umgass.org][UMGASS]] production of Gilbert and
Sullivan's [[http://www.umgass.org/current-production][The Sorcerer]]. Batya also came up from Cornell to join us so
the two families are all togehter for the first time in about 10
years.

This hasn't left much time for [[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] but I did manage to
finish yesterday's challenge this morning.

What took me so long? Much like last year, it was [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/][because I'm an
idiot]]. 

The [[http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9][problem]] seemed pretty straighforward. I coded a solution and it
worked for all the test cases. I tried it on my data set but
the grader said the answer was wrong. I went through the problem a
number of times as well sa my code. I figured I either mis-interpreted
the question or had some bug. I found neither to be true.

After some frustration, I went over to the Advent of Code [[https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/][subreddit]]
grabbed a couple of posted solutions (trying not to look at them) and
ran both on my data - those solutions got the same answer on my data
set as I did. 

This morning, I asked Batya to look over my code and the problem (it's
always good to have a daughter that's smarted than you are) but she
saw no problems.

Finally, I emailed my buddy JonAlf since I know he completed the problem. He sent back his answer along
with his data set and I got the same answer as he did on his data.
 
What could be the problem.

His data set was about 12k characters long, mine was 4k. Something had
to be wrong here. I went back to the Advent of Code site and grabbed
the data set again. This time, I went to the page and did a "save-as"
to save it - last time, I cut and pasted.

The cut and paste version was 4k, the save-as was 12k. This time it
worked and was accepted and I also finished part 2 in short order.

The moral of the story -- make sure you check the integrity of your
data set - you'll never get the right answer if you're working with
the wrong data.

In case anyone's interested, you can find my AoC code [[https://github.com/zamansky/advent2016][here]].
