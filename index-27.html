One of my favorite but little used emacs features is rectangular
editing. It's little used because I don't need it all that often. It's
one of my favorites because when I do need it, it's just so amazingly
useful.
</p>

<p>
The idea is you can mark a rectangle of text, cut it and later paste
it.  This means that if you have three columns of text:
</p>

<pre class="example">
a b c
d e f
g h i
j k l
</pre>

<p>
You can easily mark the middle column (b e h k) or even just the b e
and h, cut it and paste it elsewhere as a rectangle. You can also open
up a rectangular region (filled with whitespace). There are a couple
of other niceties but that's the basic idea.
</p>

<p>
Here's a link to all the functions:

I'm guessing my views  on this aren't very popular -that's OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren't careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we're well on our way down
that road.
</p>

<p>
I've ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE">STEM Oil Salesmen</a> <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.1">1</a></sup>
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.
</p>

<p>
I've also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE">Superficial PD and scripted curricula</a>  and my concern that   
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE">we'll be done</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it's wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I'm seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.
</p>

<p>
The other week I noticed, <a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we">this post</a> by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by <a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our">this one</a> which also highlights actually taking the exam.
</p>

<p>
This didn't sit well with me. 
</p>

<p>
What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn't drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE">assessments</a>. The college credit thing? I'm
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I'm still skeptical
here. Placement? It's a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?
</p>

<p>
Reasons not to take the exam?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it doesn't do anything for the kid, why take it</li>
<li>Stress of taking the exam</li>
<li>There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college</li>
<li>Save the expense</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a general rule, I'm against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we've been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I've
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all <b><b>fail</b></b> AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he's moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.
</p>

<p>
This follows last year's announcement that code.org was <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE">partnering with
the College Board</a> - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.2">2</a></sup> as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn't do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.
</p>

<p>
True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It's
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.
</p>

<p>
I don't doubt code.org's sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I'm
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we'll regret years from now.

Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education. 
</p>

<p>
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.
</p>

<p>
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.
</p>

<p>
Long time blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Dave Winer</a> put together <a href="http://trumpstatus.org/">trumpstatus.org</a> where he's
collecting many of the issues that we're all so alarmed with.
</p>

<p>
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I've been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.
</p>


<p>
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It's not quite as bad as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
</p>

<p>
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
</p>

<p>
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
</p>

<p>
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is <b><b>NOT</b></b> the time for business as
usual.
</p>

<p>
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations. 
</p>

<p>
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers. 
</p>

<p>
With Friday's order, the whole tech community came out.
</p>

<p>
Here's part of a thread by tech activist <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash">Anil Dash</a> calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.
</p>

<p>
If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women's
rights and on and on.
</p>

<p>
This means we all have to get involved and stay involved. 
</p>

<p>
What have I been doing?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.</li>
<li>I subscribed to <a href="https://dailyaction.org">Daily Action</a> so that I get a reminder each day of
someone I can call to make a difference.</li>
<li>I'm starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I
make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
remind our representatives who they work for.</li>
<li>Education and advocacy</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.
</p>

<p>
Thus ends my not business as usual post. What's going on in America is
not someone else's problem - it's all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.

While I use emacs for all all sorts of things, one of the things I
haven't done much is run shells from within emacs. I'm not sure
why. I'm a command line wonk and adding command line goodness and
emacs together seems like a natural. Maybe it's because back in the
day I spent a lot of time on MS-DOS systems. You could get a
reasonable Unixy facsimile using tools like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_Toolkit">MKS toolkit</a> and I like
so many other young computer scientists wrote our own small shells
when we learned C so I used that insted of command.com. 
</p>

<p>
In any event, I'm trying to use the shell within emacs more.

Here's a quick video showing both <b><b>shell</b></b>, which runs whatever your
default shell is in an emacs buffer and <b><b>eshell</b></b> which is emacs own
shell.
</p>

<p>
I use a couple of packages to smooth over a couple of things.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/porterjamesj/virtualenvwrapper.el">Virtuelenvwrapper</a> smooths things voer with the python virtaulenv and
virtualenvwrapper linux packages:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">virtualenvwrapper</span>
      <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
      <span class="nv">:config</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">venv-initialize-interactive-shells</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">venv-initialize-eshell</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Only relevant if you use Python and virtualenvs.
</p>

<p>
and more importantly, <a href="https://github.com/killdash9/better-shell">better shell</a>:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">better-shell</span>

	   <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"C-;"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">better-shell-remote-open</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
cleans things up when using a termianl to connect to a remote machine.
</p>

<p>
If you use a shell from within emacs as part of your workflow, please
post how, or better, make a video!!!!

    <p>
What essential topics should we teach in our intro courses? This seems
to be a recurring topic recently. 
</p>

<p>
It can be an important topic but, unfortunately, too often, it seems
that people have too myopic a view
</p>

<p>
I remember thinking about this years ago when APCS moved from C++ to
Java. Both languages have good and bad points both for practical and
educational use. A big loss in the move to Java was memory management
and the topics you could cover when memory issues arose. 
</p>

<p>
Of course one might say that memory management shouldn't be in the
first year of CS. That's fine, as long as you put it back in somewhere
later on - something that didn't seem to happen universally. 
</p>

<p>
That's the myopic view - far too few look at the overall picture.
</p>

<p>
C++ to Java ended up in removing a topic. I've also seen the reverse. 
I was talking to a friend about intro topics. He told me that it was
critical to cover (insert topic here) in an intro course. Why, I
asked? Because the kids absolutely needed to know that material in the
third year course he was teaching.
</p>

<p>
I pressed a bit – "how many kids actually remember (insert topic
here) and do you have to reteach anything." The answer - pretty much
no one remembered and he always retaught the subject.
</p>

<p>
Did this mean that no one taught the topic in the earlier class?
Unlikely. More likely is that the topic was taught without purpose or
context, just because it was supposed to be taught and thus the
knowledge wasn't retained. Sounds to me like the topic wasn't in the
right place to begin with. Maybe it should have just been taught in
that 300 level course to begin with.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Alfred Thompson</a> wrote a post earlier today asking about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/01/how-important-are-number-bases-for-pre.html">teaching
number bases</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Is it important? Maybe. Is it essential for an intro course? Probably
not. 
</p>

<p>
Binary makes sense when you start talking about low level stuff. If
your intro course never gets close to the machine then why muddy the water
with a topic that's out of place. The topic probably won't be
appreciated and retention and understanding will be low. 
</p>

<p>
If your intro course gets close to the machine or if you decide to
talk about compiled code or similar topics, you have an entre to talk
binary which leads to the convenience of hexadecimal. At Stuyvesant,
it was much more sensible to talk about number bases in our systems
course when we looked at C code in a debugger rather than in our intro
our AP course. 
</p>

<p>
You also might work on some application where bitmaps or similar as
useful. That might be another good time to talk about number bases.
</p>

<p>
Is it important for a CS person to understand binary and it's relation
to digital computers? Certainly. Does it have to be studied day one?
Certainly not.
</p>

<p>
We need to keep an eye on the big picture. You can't get everything
into a single class or a single yea. The question to ask is - do our students know what they have to by the time they
leave our charge?

A while ago I did a couple of videos on how I use org-capture
(<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-24-capture-2/">part 2</a>). I didn't get into a big part of org-capture - how I
use org-mode and capture to manage my calendar and todo lists.
</p>

<p>
I was waiting to see if I liked my current setup - using <a href="https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el">org-gcal</a> to
sync with my Google Calendar for appointments while using my main org
file for my todo list.
</p>

<p>
Coincidentally, Rainer König recently put up a video on how he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIzzjSaq2N8&amp;amp;list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&amp;amp;index=33">syncs
with his Google calendar</a>. He uses a different method than the one I
present in this video so make sure to check out his approach. In fact,
you should check out his entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE">series on org-mode</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's the code I use install org-gcal. The video steps through
setting up things on the Google side. You'll have to replace the
<b><b>client ID</b></b> and <b><b>client secrets</b></b> in the code below as well as use
your calendar name and whatever org file you want to sync with.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">package-check-signature</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">org-gcal</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-gcal-client-id</span> <span class="s">"oauth 2.0 client ID"</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
I use these two hooks to sync things semi-automatically. The first
hook syncs whenever I load the agenda. Since this happens in the
background, if I just added something to my calendar, I might have to
reload the agenda by hitting <b><b>r</b></b> in the agenda view. 
</p>

<p>
The second hook syncs with my Google calendar when I capture.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-agenda-mode-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-gcal-sync</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-capture-after-finalize-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-gcal-sync</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Here are the rest of my settings. The org files I want to include in
my agenda views:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>gcal.org – the one I'm syncing</li>
<li>i.org – my main org file for todo items (the todo capture places
things in here)</li>
<li>schedule.org – my old schedule before I was syncing with
Google. Not active anymore. I should probably remove it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, my capture settings:
</p>

	 <span class="s">"* %?\n%i\n"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>



<p>
The end result is that I can add an event in my Google calendar (or
accept a calendar invite) and it appears in my org-mode
agenda. Likewise, I can add a scheduled event using capture and it
will sync up to Google. I can also just add an event by editing
gcal.org but then would have to run <b><b>org-gcal-post-at-point</b></b> to send
it up to Google.
</p>

<p>
Now, I can use bring up a regular agenda <b><b>C-a a</b></b>, my todo list <b><b>C-a
t</b></b> or by adding a custom agenda command:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-custom-commands</span>
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">"c"</span> <span class="s">"Simple agenda view"</span>
	 <span class="p">((</span><span class="nf">agenda</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">)</span>
	  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">alltodo</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
a combined agenda and todo view using <b><b>C-a n</b></b>
</p>


<p>
Finally, there's <a href="https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw">calfw</a>. It's a nice tool to view calendars in
Google. I don't use it much anymore but it is nice:
</p>

Over on Facebook, a friend commented on my last post. He commented on
the rigor of BA vs BS degrees. The comment mentioned Physics and Math
degrees but I thought Id follow up a bit on CS degrees.
</p>

<p>
I took a quick look at three computer science programs - Cornell,
UMich, and Queens College. Cornell because my daughter is there,
UMich, my son, and Queens College because it's a CUNY college that
offers both a BS and a BA in computer science.

<p>
Here's a link to Cornell's <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/csmajor">CS Major page</a>. Same requirements for a BA
through their School of Arts and Sciences as for their BS in the
School of Engineering. The differences are limited to the fundamental
school differences.

<li>Similar Senior Design experiences</li>
<li>Identical Upper Level Elective requirement</li>

and <a href="http://www.cs.qc.edu/undergrad/BA.pdf">BA</a> requirements, they're the same.

In all cases, the differences are
the fundamental difference between the extra liberal arts and
distribution requirements in an Arts and Sciences school and the extra
science and math courses required of an engineering school.
</p>

<p>
Which is better? It all depends. For me, personally, the liberal arts
education is very important. For others, it will be the deep dive into
science. Maybe more phyics will better enable a CS major to solve some
technical problem but then again, maybe a culteral anthropology course
will help a CS major see the world and people differently and also
color her work.
</p>

<p>
To my original point - the important thing is that we do a better job
informing guidance counselors, teachers, and high school students as
to the possibilities so that they can make informed decisions.

    <blockquote>
<p>
I didn't know Hunter College had computer science.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high
schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS's low
profile and small size in spite of its high quality.
</p>

<p>
Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer
Science programs. I'd hear things like "but they only offer a BA not a
BS," or "but Hunter isn't an engineering school."
</p>

<p>
I've come to realize that we have to do a better job educating kids as
to what can come next after high school.
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure why many assume that CS has to be under
engineering. When I was applying to college, most of my choices were
Arts and Science schools offering BAs in CS. Maybe it's because people don't
disagregate STEM subjects. Even though it's not a computer science
program many schools seem to associate FIRST robotics with computer
science. Likewise any class with even a modicum of coding becomes
computer science and as makerspaces and robotics are a percieved as
easy entry STEM classes that appear to be CS (something I'll rant
about in a future post), CS becomes associated with engineering.
</p>

<p>
It's easy enough to explain the difference between a BA in CS and a BS
in CS and it's equally easy to show that you can have tremendous
success either way. All you have to do to show the validity of a BA in
CS is look at succesful people from places like NYU, Courant, Columbia
College (as opposed to Columbia Engineering), Cornell school of Arts
and Sciences, etc to balance successful people from the engineering schools.
</p>

<p>
As I'm sure you know, I'm pretty high on Hunter CS and it's certainly
one of the best value CS educations out there. Personally, I'm a big believer in a
liberal arts education but in any case, as a community we have to do a
better job educating the high schools so that graduating seniors are
best informed when deciding on their futures.

Today's video talks about using emacs <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">Tramp</a> mode.
</p>

<p>
Tramp mode allows you to edit remote files using your local emacs. I usually do this over ssh.
</p>

<p>
To edit a file on a machine <b><b>www.cstuy.org</b></b> I would first
<b><b>find-file</b></b> using <b><b>C-c C-f</b></b> and then for the file name to open:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">/ssh:www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">cstuy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">org:/home/zamansky/sc/testfile</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
this would open the file <b><b>testfile</b></b> in the absolute directory
<b><b>/home/zamansky/sc</b></b>. If my username on the remote machine is
different:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">/ssh:username@www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">cstuy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">org:/home/zamansky/sc/testfile</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
And I can also work relative to my home directory:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">/ssh:username@www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">cstuy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">org:sc/testfile</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
If I just hit enter after the machine name and <b><b>:</b></b> - 
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">/ssh:username@www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">cstuy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">org:</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I end up in a dired buffer on the remote machine.
</p>

<p>
Likewise if I run a <b><b>shell</b></b> or <b><b>eshell</b></b> in the tramp buffer, it
will run the shell on the remote machine. In the video I showed how
shell didn't work because locally, I'm configured to use zsh and I
don't have zsh installed remotely. Eshell, however, worked fine.
</p>

<p>
Using tramp in this way gives us all of the power of our local emacs
configuration to edit a file on a remote machine.
</p>

<p>
You can also use tramp to edit local files as root using sudo:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">sudo::/tmp/sc/rootfile</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Note the double colon. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can do the double-whammy - remote root editing:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">ssh::www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">cstu</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">org|sudo:www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">cstuy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">org:/home/zamansky/sc/rootfile</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
If you use zsh and any of this freezes, just do a search on "zsh
tramp" and the top couple of hits will tell you what to add to your
configuration files to fix things.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I mentioned in the video that I don't use tramp all that much
anymore. That's mostly because I don't do much remote editing
anymore. I used it more when I was administering a number of machines
at Stuyvesant. 
</p>

<p>
I still use it periodically, but I also use <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs">sshfs</a>, a Linux tool (which
may be available for other operating systems) that allows me to mount
a directory tree from a remote machine and use it on my local machine.
