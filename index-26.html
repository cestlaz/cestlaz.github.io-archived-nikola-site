We're now at the end of my first semester at Hunter. The Spring term
classes don't start until the end of January. I've got an assortment
of projects to work on but some of the students should have a nice
block of relatively free time.
</p>

<p>
I  wanted to share some recommendations on things to explore with a
few student groups and thought it would be easier to write those
recommendations down here once and then just share a link.
</p>

<p>
So, here we go.
</p>

<p>
Much of the first few CS classes at Hunter and elsewhere focus on the
fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms. It's all
good stuff but students want to supplement that classroom knowledge
with some practical skills.
</p>

<p>
I recommend playing with a language like Python that can be used in
all sorts of domains. If you haven't played with it, check it out.
</p>

<p>
I like <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a> as a nice, free, online
text.
</p>

<p>
I'd also recommend learning a web platform like <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask.</a> Flask is a web
framework in Python. The web site has a nice getting started guide and
tutorial but here are a couple of other great learning Flask
resources:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/realpython/discover-flask">Discover Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/">Explore Flask</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Once armed with the above, you'll be well positioned to work on a
variety of your own projects, enter hackathons, and more.
</p>

<p>
I'm also a big believer in using good tools. I love the emacs text
editor. Why not spend some time going through the web series on <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs">Using
Emacs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you're not using Git, you should be. Here are a couple of
playlists to get you started:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you haven't done so already, head over to <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github Education</a> and
sign up for a student developer pack.
</p>

<p>
So, there are a few recommendations on things to work on before the
next term begins.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy

Today's <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/19">Advent of Code</a> problem was a variant on the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JosephusProblem.html">Josephus
problem</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I recalled that there was a formula to figure out the 
sole survivor but I decide to run a simulation rather than looking it
up. I also decided to write it up in C++, well, really C with cout
instead of printf.
</p>

<p>
Part 1 was the traditional problem. Part 2 was a variant where at each
iteration, you remove the elf opposite the elf being processed (see
the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/19">problem description</a> for details).
</p>

<p>
For both solutions I coded up a circular doubly linked list:

</pre></div>

<p>
You can see my complete solutions <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2016/blob/master/day19.cpp">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking about how I wrote the code – I just rolled it off the
top of my head. The same was true for the earlier AoC problems where I
had to implement a breadth first search or something similar. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not making a statement about my amazing coding abilities - linked
lists and graph searches are pretty basic, but rather than having done
the CS thing for so long, these fundamentals have become somewhat
routine. I haven't really written C code in years but other than a
couple of typos (and a stupid mistake in calculating steps) things
worked right off the bat. 
</p>

<p>
I remember a time when I was in college or even a young professional
when I would use an array and an index as a stack or queue - not
because it made more sense but rather, because I wasn't fully
comfortable with memory manipulation and linked lists. The same could
be said for my first few years working with anything more than the
simplest recursion.
</p>

<p>
All of this is to say that it does get easier.
</p>

<p>
Things that seem trivial to us now seemed
insurmountable when we were beginners. Last year, I wrote about an overnight homework
assignment I gave to my class that would have been a final project a
year earlier (the post is <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-11-taking-stock-self-assess.html/#.WFiGl99iekA">here</a> but the homework links are no longer
active) and a few weeks ago I recall a fellow CS teacher talking about
how much longer it takes his students to write a chunk of code than it
takes the teacher.
</p>

<p>
New things are challenging and take time but with practice and
persistence techniques that were once daunting can become tools ready
at our disposal to use on a whim.

I got an email from my good friend and mentor this weekend. Danny
Jaye, after 45 years, is finally retiring for real.
</p>

<p>
Danny, the Maestro, or Doc, as we sometimes called him spent most of
his career at Stuyvesant. First as a math teacher, then math
chair. Danny also spent time as the director of the Bergen Academies
and his last few years as the Chief Academic Officer at Solomon
Schecter in Bergen.
</p>

<p>
Danny's always been a master teacher - back in the day, he managed to
teach Calculus to my brother - no small feat and as a department and
school leader, he has a great eye for collecting and developing
talent. Over the years, Danny's influenced a number people who've gone
on to be education leaders of one form or another.
</p>

<p>
For me, Danny was and continues to be a great mentor. I can't tell you
how much I learned - much of it on our 5:00am bike rides from Stuy up
to the GW bridge and back.
</p>

<p>
Far too much to share here but let me drop a couple of thoughts:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It doesn't cost anything to be nice.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and the related:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's easy to be nice on a good day.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The former talking about treating everyone with respect regardless of
station and the latter a reminder not to forget it on a bad day. Also a
valuable reminder when sizing up new school leaders.
</p>

<p>
We'd spend hours discussing class, departmental, and school
strategies. How to develop a program with safety nets, how to separate
real value from the hypes and how to always remember that it's the
student first and the big picture, not just our little corner of the world.
</p>


<p>
It feels weird for me to know that my go to guy on Ed stuff is no
longer working and is now moving towards a life of leisure.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't change anything other than a reminder to me that I'm now
one of the more senior people in my circles and that now Danny can
mock me for having to go in to the office every day.
</p>

<p>
So, here's to you Danny – one of the best education people out
there.

Today was the last day of classes at Hunter thus ending my first
semester of teaching at Hunter College.
</p>

<p>
I very much enjoyed the semester and my class and look forward to
working with the same group when the spring term starts in a few
weeks. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time, even though I'm a quarter century veteran teacher,
in many ways this was like my rookie season all over again.
</p>

<p>
My class was an honors intro class so the material wasn't new to me
but there were a number of adjustments going from high school to college.
</p>

<p>
I taught a few college classes as an adjunct back in the nineties but
I was a young teacher at the time and that was a lifetime ago.
</p>

<p>
The biggest difference is that we only met two days a week. Monday and
Thursday and we met for 1:45 rather than 45 minutes. The longer class
is nice but the twice a week means that you don't get that every day
reinforcement you have in high school.
</p>

<p>
It also means that there were times when we would go a week between
classes due to a single day off. 
</p>

<p>
The biggest challenge, one that I'm continuing to work on, is figuring
out how much we can do in a class, what and how much to assign between
classes and what's the best way to motivate the student's to space out
the work while doing something every day.
</p>

<p>
That wasn't much of a challenge at Stuy. Having been there so long, I
had a good feel for my students as well as the pace and rhythm of
Stuy. Hunter has it's own rhythm and pace and I'm still figuring it
out.
</p>

<p>
We also had to pivot early on as the student laptops didn't arrive
until a third of the semester was over.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, much of my work these days has to do with
developing the overall honors program as well as Hunter's forthcoming
teacher education programs in CS so I'm only teaching a single class
right now and it's small.
</p>


<p>
If there are any rookie teachers reading this, congratulations on
getting through your first semester. I know you guys go a little bit
longer, but you're in the home stretch.
</p>

<p>
Teaching right, particularly in public schools with large classes  will
always be an all in activity - certainly harder and more draining than
anything I ever did in industry but it does get easier as you learn
your school and students and develop your craft.

I'm spending the weekend up in Michigan. Visiting my brother and is
family. We're here to see the <a href="http://umgass.org">UMGASS</a> production of Gilbert and
Sullivan's <a href="http://www.umgass.org/current-production">The Sorcerer</a>. Batya also came up from Cornell to join us so
the two families are all togehter for the first time in about 10
years.
</p>

<p>
This hasn't left much time for <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> but I did manage to
finish yesterday's challenge this morning.
</p>

<p>
What took me so long? Much like last year, it was <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/">because I'm an
idiot</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9">problem</a> seemed pretty straighforward. I coded a solution and it
worked for all the test cases. I tried it on my data set but
the grader said the answer was wrong. I went through the problem a
number of times as well sa my code. I figured I either mis-interpreted
the question or had some bug. I found neither to be true.
</p>

<p>
After some frustration, I went over to the Advent of Code <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">subreddit</a>
grabbed a couple of posted solutions (trying not to look at them) and
ran both on my data - those solutions got the same answer on my data
set as I did. 
</p>

<p>
This morning, I asked Batya to look over my code and the problem (it's
always good to have a daughter that's smarted than you are) but she
saw no problems.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I emailed my buddy JonAlf since I know he completed the problem. He sent back his answer along
with his data set and I got the same answer as he did on his data.
</p>

<p>
What could be the problem.
</p>

<p>
His data set was about 12k characters long, mine was 4k. Something had
to be wrong here. I went back to the Advent of Code site and grabbed
the data set again. This time, I went to the page and did a "save-as"
to save it - last time, I cut and pasted.
</p>

<p>
The cut and paste version was 4k, the save-as was 12k. This time it
worked and was accepted and I also finished part 2 in short order.
</p>

<p>
The moral of the story – make sure you check the integrity of your
data set - you'll never get the right answer if you're working with
the wrong data.

Today we're looking at <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> 2016 <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2">number 2</a>.
</p>

<p>
To change things up, I thought I'd do a video where I live code a solution.
</p>

<p>
The solution I present is pretty straightforward - use a 2D array (or
technically, an array of strings) to represent the keypad, parse the
input, and follow the input instructions to build the code. 
</p>

<p>
One of the things I really like about Advent of Code is that every
problem has two parts and depending on how you solved part 1, you may
or may not have extra work to do for part 2.
</p>

<p>
A couple of years ago, I wrote about one of the coding techniques I
try to convey to my students. The idea of <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data.md">changing the data</a> to take
away edge and special cases. 
</p>

<p>
Part two of this problem is a perfect time to use that technique.
</p>

<p>
Here's the video, I hope you enjoy it:

    <p>
I recently <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-of-code-2016/">posted</a> about <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> - a series of programming
problems relseased one a day. While they vary in terms of level of
difficulty, a number of them make nice problems for introductory to
mid level programming classes.
</p>

<p>
I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on a few of them starting with
the first problem from this years competition.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1">Take a minute to read it over.</a>
</p>

<p>
At first glance, it might seem to a young programmer that this problem
requires a two dimensional array - all about (x,y) coordinates but
then there's a problem - there are no limits on coordinates and we
can't make an unlimited size array.
</p>

<p>
After thinking a bit, hopefully the programmer realizes that all they
need to do is keep track of the how the <b><b>(x,y)</b></b> location changes over
time. In the solution below, we start at <b><b>(0,0)</b></b> and count the steps as
we update two variables <b><b>x</b></b> and <b><b>y</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
When we finish processing the moves, we have our current location in
<b><b>(x,y)</b></b> and we have the number of steps taken to get there.
</p>

<p>
The solution below hsa a couple of niceties that a beginning
programmer might not know or use (and I'm not arguing that what's written is
superior in any way, it's just what I ended up writing).
</p>

<p>
I make use of tuple destructuring:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
which assigns <b><b>x</b></b> to the first item in the tuple and <b><b>y</b></b> the
second. I used that a number of times 
</p>

<p>
I also use a list  I call <b><b>dirs</b></b> to hold dx and dy values for the
four direcitons:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">dirs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This made it easier to to update the location based on the 4
directions. I could also have just used if statements.
</p>

<p>
Here's all the code:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># assume our starting location is 0,0</span>

<span class="c1"># we start with d=0 -&gt; facing north</span>
<span class="c1"># as we turn left or right, we can just increment or decrement d</span>
<span class="c1"># and dirs[d] will give us the appropriate dx and dy to update</span>
<span class="c1"># our locatoin for the next step</span>
<span class="n">dirs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)]</span>   
<span class="n">d</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="c1"># This is only needed for part 2  - We track visited locations</span>

Not much in today's actual post. The video is a continuation of the last one on <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1">org-capture</a>.
</p>

<p>
The video goes over how I set things up to pop up a new frame to do a
capture even if emacs isn't on screen (as long as it's running) by
hitting <b><b>F1</b></b>. I would  have preferred to bind to <b><b>C-c c</b></b> - the
same as within emacs but I havn't figured out how to do that in Ubuntu
or Mint Linux yet.
</p>

<p>
Here's the elisp code for the configuration file to do the heavy
lifting. I can't for th elife of me remember who's blog I found it
on. If anyone knows, please leave a comment - I'd like to give credit
where credit's due:

sync with my Google calendar and want to figure out a config I'm happy
with before making that video.

Once again, it's time for <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> - a series of small
programming problems released once a day. 
</p>

<p>
I wrote a bit about it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-15-advent.html/">last</a> <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/#.WEMqBB9ieYQ">year</a> and you can still find last years
problems <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2015/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice
for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I'm thinking of
looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.
</p>

<p>
I didn't think about this much last year but one thing I really like
about the competition is that each problem comes in two parts. You're
first presented with the problem and the input and once you put in the
correct answer, you're presented with part two.
</p>

<p>
This can be annoying at times, particularly when it requires a large
code rewrite but it also means that well designed, not too specific
solutions are rewarded. 
</p>

<p>
It's not quite the same as changing the specs on a project mid way but
it does encourage thinking about more than just solving a super
specific problem.
</p>

<p>
Check out <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> and see if it's something you or your classes
might enjoy.

The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who's policies you strongly
disagreed with?
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to
get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or
would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote
positions you disagree with.
</p>

<p>
Tough question.
</p>

<p>
The original question implied national level positions. I've never and
will never breath such rarefied air but I have had such experiences
closer to ground level, both with DOE projects and also in
conversations with some charter chains.
</p>

<p>
My take?
</p>

<p>
Anyone that knows me knows that I've had various dealings with the NYC
DOE and also knows that those dealings never resulted in outcomes I
was happy with. Over my time at Stuy, I had many philosophical
differences with Tweed (a common nickname for the NYC DOE as they're
housed in the old Tweed courthouse) and these were times where I tried
to play nice to have a seat at the table.
</p>

<p>
Once I was at a meeting that also included a number of tech industry
heavy hitters. After the meeting, one came over to me. He knew me
by having worked with my former students. I knew him by reputation. He
asked "do they really want our thoughts on this or are we just here so
that they can do what they wanted in the first place and then parade us out 
to say that they consulted experts in the tech industry?" I honestly
didn't know at the time but I had my doubts as to the DOE's sincerity
in being open to either my views or this CTO's As it turned out, they
just did want to parade us. Later in the process, I was told in a back
room that it would be wise of me not to publicly voice my thoughts
about the direction of one particular project.
</p>

<p>
So there you have it. I was given a seat at the table but only as long
as my views mirrored the views of those in power. Not really much of a
seat. 
</p>

<p>
I've also sat down with some charter chains - chains that I've been
more than happy to denounce publicly. Why did I take the meetings?
Mostly to find out if I was mistaken in my position and if so, maybe
I could help them. Every time I've had such a meeting, however, I've
left the table with my feelings unchanged and knowing that I would
never willingly help them as I felt their practices were harmful to
kids.
</p>

<p>
In one case, I took the seat but failed to affect change. In the other
I refused the seat. I'll always take a meeting and I'll always work
with someone who wants to help kids and who has an open mind but I've
found that the more powerful the player, at least in education, the
more likely they are to just want confirmation of their own bias.
</p>

<p>
You might get a seat at the table but you also might end up lending
your reputation to a cause you don't believe in.
